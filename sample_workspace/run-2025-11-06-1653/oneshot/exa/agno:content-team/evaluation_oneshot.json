      "reasoning": "Step 1: User requirements\n- Use the Agno Python framework with multi-agent teams.\n- Create a content generation system for a stainless, eco-friendly water bottle launch.\n- Team outputs must include: (a) a blog outline, (b) 3–5 credible source links, (c) a final 1‑page blog post in Markdown.\n- Role constraints: the writer must cite the researcher’s sources; the planner must ensure a clear buyer persona.\n\nStep 2: Oracle implementation (inferred from scenario and provided Agno examples)\n- Likely uses agno.agent.Agent with agno.models.openai.OpenAIChat and agno.tools.duckduckgo.DuckDuckGoTools.\n- Multi-agent orchestration via agno.workflow.v2 with Workflow, Step, Parallel; a sequence such as Research → Plan → Write (and possibly Synthesis) is expected.\n- Agents would need to share intermediate artifacts (research links, buyer persona) so that the writer can cite the researcher’s sources.\n- Parameters seen: Agent(name, model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-4o\"), tools=[...], instructions=[...], storage=SqliteAgentStorage(...), add_datetime_to_instructions=True, add_history_to_messages=True, num_history_responses=5, markdown=True). Workflow(steps=[Parallel(...), Step(...)]). Usage like workflow.print_response(prompt, markdown=True).\n- Return/usage: Examples show printing via print_response; no detailed return structures or inter-step data passing shown.\n\nStep 3: MCP context coverage vs. requirements\n1) API/Function names\n- Present for agent construction and workflow setup:\n  • \"web_agent = Agent(..., model=OpenAIChat(id='gpt-4o'), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], instructions=['Always include sources'], ... , markdown=True)\" (Medium article code).\n  • \"workflow = Workflow(... steps=[Parallel(Step(...), ...), Step(name='Synthesis', agent=synthesizer)])\" and \"workflow.print_response('Write about the latest AI developments', markdown=True)\" (Workflow v2 README).\n- Missing: Clear API to run an Agent and capture its response (e.g., agent.run/ask) and pass it to another Agent in Python. The context only shows Playground app creation and print_response.\n\n2) Parameter types, names, purposes\n- For Agent constructor parameters: inferable from snippet (name:str, model:OpenAIChat, tools:list, instructions:list[str], storage:SqliteAgentStorage, flags like add_history_to_messages:bool, markdown:bool).\n- For Workflow/Step: Step(name:str, agent=...) and Parallel(Step, ...). However, how inputs/outputs flow between steps is not documented.\n- For DuckDuckGoTools: presence is shown but parameters and invocation patterns are not documented in the context (no examples of how the agent calls tools or what they return).\n\n3) Return value structure\n- Not provided for Agent execution. The only example is \"workflow.print_response(...)\" which prints output; no return object, schema, or how to capture structured outputs (outline, list of links, final markdown) is shown.\n- No documentation on the structure of tool outputs (e.g., DuckDuckGo search results) to programmatically extract 3–5 credible links.\n\n4) Usage patterns\n- Some patterns for constructing agents and workflows:\n  • Agent creation and storage via SqliteAgentStorage.\n  • Playground app via \"Playground(agents=[web_agent, finance_agent]).get_app()\".\n  • Workflow composition with Parallel and Step; printing a response in Markdown.\n- Missing critical usage patterns for chaining agent outputs (research → plan → write) and enforcing that the writer cites the researcher’s sources via shared context or message passing.\n\n5) Error handling\n- No Agno-specific error handling patterns shown. The only error example is from an unrelated Mastra JS snippet (throws if topic missing), which does not apply to Agno Python.\n\n6) Meeting explicit constraints\n- Agno framework: yes, context includes Agno snippets.\n- Multi-agent: yes, examples for multiple Agents and Workflow/Parallel exist.\n- Research capabilities: DuckDuckGoTools is shown, but no invocation/return structure.\n- Ensuring writer cites researcher’s sources: Not supported by the given context—no demonstrated mechanism for passing the researcher’s extracted links to the writer agent or for enforcing citation.\n- Planner ensuring buyer persona: You could set instructions for the planner, but no demonstrated way to ensure or validate that downstream agents used that persona.\n\nEvidence quotes\n- Agent setup with tools and instructions: \"web_agent = Agent( name='Web Agent', model=OpenAIChat(id='gpt-4o'), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], instructions=['Always include sources'], storage=SqliteAgentStorage(...), add_datetime_to_instructions=True, add_history_to_messages=True, num_history_responses=5, markdown=True,)\".\n- Workflow orchestration: \"workflow = Workflow( name='Parallel Research Pipeline', steps=[ Parallel( Step(name='HackerNews Research', agent=hn_researcher), Step(name='Web Research', agent=web_researcher), Step(name='Academic Research', agent=academic_researcher), name='Research Phase' ), Step(name='Synthesis', agent=synthesizer), ] )\" and \"workflow.print_response('Write about the latest AI developments', markdown=True)\".\n\nStep 4: Decision\n- Completeness: INCOMPLETE. Critical gaps: no documented method to execute agents and capture outputs, no inter-agent data passing or shared context mechanism shown, no return value schemas, no tool invocation/return details, and no error handling guidance. These prevent reliably implementing the full system where the writer cites the researcher’s sources and the planner’s buyer persona is enforced.\n- Relevance: TRUE. The context includes directly relevant Agno snippets (Agent, OpenAIChat, DuckDuckGoTools, Workflow/Parallel) but is noisy with unrelated frameworks.\n- Overall score: 2 (Below Average). Some foundations are present, but multiple critical implementation details are missing to reproduce oracle-level functionality without guessing."

The examples are too generic and don't provide enough information to infer the complete API signatures, parameter types, and coordination patterns needed for the specific use case."

      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - Use Agno Python framework for multi-agent teams; create content generation system for a stainless, eco-friendly water bottle launch; produce 1-page blog post with (a) outline, (b) 3-5 credible source links, (c) final copy in markdown; writer must cite researcher's sources; planner ensures clear buyer persona. Explicit constraints: Agno framework, multi-agent setup, specific output components, citation and persona requirements.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - The oracle would likely import from agno (e.g., Agent, Workflow, Parallel, Step, OpenAIChat, DuckDuckGoTools); create agents like planner (with instructions for buyer persona), researcher (with search tools for sources), writer (with instructions to cite sources and output markdown); orchestrate via Workflow with Steps or Parallel for research and synthesis; use models like gpt-4o; parameters include name, model, tools, instructions; returns involve running the workflow to generate outputs.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For Agno framework and multi-agent teams: Context provides code examples with Agent creation (e.g., name, model=OpenAIChat(id='gpt-4o'), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], instructions=['Always include sources'], etc.) and Workflow with Parallel/Step using agents (e.g., Parallel(Step(name='Web Research', agent=web_researcher), ...)). Inferable: API names (Agent, Workflow, Parallel, Step), parameters (e.g., model as OpenAIChat object, tools as list, instructions as list/string), return structures (Workflow.print_response() for output), usage (full code snippets showing instantiation and running). For content system: Examples include research agents with search tools, synthesis steps, instructions for sources/markdown. For specific outputs (outline, sources, markdown): Inferable via custom instructions (e.g., 'Always include sources', markdown=True) and workflow steps for phased generation. For citations and persona: Custom instructions can enforce (e.g., 'cite sources', 'ensure buyer persona'). Tools for sources: DuckDuckGoTools shown. All 6 checklist items inferable: e.g., parameter types from examples (strings, lists, objects), usage patterns in full scripts.\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness=true because all requirements are addressable; context provides full inference for APIs, params (e.g., 'tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]'), returns (e.g., agent responses via workflow), usage (e.g., 'workflow = Workflow(steps=[Parallel(...), Step(...)])'), no guessing needed, explicit Agno constraint met. Relevance=true as context directly covers Agno multi-agent setups for research/content tasks. Overall excellent with no gaps."
