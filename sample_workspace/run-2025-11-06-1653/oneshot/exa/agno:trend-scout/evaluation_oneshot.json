      "reasoning": "Step 1: User requirements\n- Use the Agno Python framework to build a trend scout agent.\n- Find the top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News right now.\n- Cross-check each with the latest web coverage.\n- Output per tool: a tight brief with 3 bullet takeaways, links (HN + news), and a 1-sentence risk note.\n- Implied: live data access (HN + web search), and enough structure to produce the specific output.\n\nStep 2: Oracle implementation (inferred from the context)\n- Agno Agent setup with OpenAIChat and a web search tool: from agno.agent import Agent; from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat; from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools; agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-4o-mini\"), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], ...); agent.run(...). (Initialize Agno Agent with OpenAIChat and DuckDuckGoTools)\n- Fetch HN data via Firebase API: topstories endpoint and per-item endpoint; function fetch_top_hacker_news_stories(top_n: int) returns a list of dicts with 'title' and 'url', includes try/except for requests errors. (Fetch Top Hacker News Stories with Firebase API)\n- Filter for AI launches via LLM prompt over fetched articles. (Filter and Format AI Project Launches from HackerNews)\n- Use search tool to find latest coverage and compile sources. (Initialize Agno Agent with OpenAIChat and DuckDuckGoTools; Create Research Agent with ... DuckDuckGoTools and instructions to include sources)\n- Produce formatted brief.\n\nAPIs/parameters/returns used in examples:\n- Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=str), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], markdown=bool, debug_mode=bool); agent.run(prompt: str) -> likely str response. (no explicit return type documented)\n- fetch_top_hacker_news_stories(top_n: int) -> returns json.dumps(list[{'title': str, 'url': str}]) or [] on error. (inconsistent type: string vs list)\n- DuckDuckGoTools() constructor shown, but no method signatures/return schemas exposed; used implicitly by the Agent.\n\nStep 3: MCP context coverage per requirement\n1) Use Agno framework\n- API/function names: Provided (Agent, OpenAIChat, DuckDuckGoTools). Evidence: \"agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\"), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], ...)\".\n- Parameters: Model id (string), tools list, booleans. Inferred from examples. Return of agent.run not explicitly documented.\n- Usage patterns: agent.run(\"...\") and agent.print_response(..., stream=True). Evidence: Agno + OpenTelemetry and Weave examples.\n- Error handling: No Agno-specific error handling shown.\n\n2) Find top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News right now\n- API/function names: HN Firebase endpoints shown. Evidence: \"https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json\" and per item endpoint.\n- Parameters: fetch_top_hacker_news_stories(top_n: int). Clear in example.\n- Return structure: list of dicts with 'title' and 'url' (but returned as json string). Inconsistency noted; no 'id'/HN link included.\n- Usage patterns: Basic requests.get + json parsing shown.\n- Gaps:\n  • Determining \"emerging AI tools\" is not directly supported; the context proposes using LLM filtering over article list (\"filter this list to only launches of new AI projects\"). This is usable but not guaranteed precise.\n  • \"Right now\" suggests newest/current items; only 'topstories' endpoint is shown. No context for 'newstories' or 'showstories' endpoints or time filters to ensure recency.\n  • Constructing the HN post link (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=...) is not documented; returned structure omits item id. Would require guessing.\n\n3) Cross-check with latest web coverage\n- API/function names: DuckDuckGoTools exists; also other frameworks show web search tools, but Agno’s DuckDuckGoTools is the relevant one.\n- Parameters/returns: Not documented for DuckDuckGoTools; usage is implicit via the Agent (ReAct-like). No direct method signatures or return schemas.\n- Usage patterns: Provide instructions; the LLM decides when to call the tool. Evidence: \"Create a research agent ... tools=[DuckDuckGoTools(), ...]; instructions=['Always include sources']\".\n- Gaps: No documented way to constrain search by time (\"latest\"), no return shape if you needed to programmatically verify. Reliant on LLM behavior.\n\n4) Output formatting: 3 bullet takeaways, links (HN + news), 1-sentence risk per tool\n- Achievable via LLM prompting using agent.run/print_response. Evidence: multiple examples show instructing agent to include sources/format.\n- Gap: To include the HN link reliably, you need the item id; not present in the fetch example’s return structure.\n\nChecklist assessment\n1. API/function names: Partial. Agno Agent and HN API names provided; DuckDuckGoTools exists but methods undocumented. You can still rely on LLM tool use.\n2. Parameter types: Provided for Agent ctor and HN fetch; missing for DuckDuckGoTools methods (since not exposed).\n3. Parameter names/purposes: Clear for Agent ctor and HN fetch; unclear for DuckDuckGoTools internals.\n4. Return value structure: HN fetch returns a json string of [{'title','url'}] but inconsistent and lacks HN 'id'; Agent.run return type not documented; DuckDuckGoTools return type not documented.\n5. Usage patterns: Shown for Agent.run and HN fetch; implicit LLM-tool use for search.\n6. Error handling: Present for HN fetch (try/except RequestException); absent for Agent/tools behavior.\n\nKey evidence quotes\n- Agno agent setup: \"agent = Agent( model=OpenAIChat(id=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\"), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], markdown=True, debug_mode=True,)\" and \"agent.run(\\\"What is currently trending on Twitter?\\\")\"\n- HN API fetching: \"top_stories_url = 'https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/topstories.json'\" and per item \"f'https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/item/{story_id}.json'\"\n- Filtering AI launches with LLM: \"filter this list to only launches of new AI projects: {{fetched_articles}}\"\n- Research agent with sources: \"tools=[DuckDuckGoTools(), YFinanceTools(...)]\" and instructions: \"Always include sources\"\n\nStep 4: Decision\n- Completeness: INCOMPLETE. Critical gaps remain: no documented way to obtain/construct the HN item link (item id not returned), no DuckDuckGoTools method signatures/return schemas or time-filtering guidance for \"latest\" coverage, and no documented Agent/tool error-handling behavior. Meeting all specific output requirements without guessing (especially the HN link) is not guaranteed.\n- Relevance: HIGH. The context strongly aligns with Agno agents, HN retrieval, and web search/summarization.\n\nOverall: Score 3 (Average). Enough to prototype a plausible solution by relying on LLM/tool autonomy, but missing concrete API/return details and some specifics needed to implement the oracle behavior deterministically without guessing."

      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements Analysis - The user requires: (1) Build a trend scout agent using Agno Python framework, (2) Find top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News, (3) Cross-check with latest web coverage, (4) Provide brief with bullet points, links, and risk notes. Step 2: Oracle Implementation Analysis - The oracle would need: Hacker News API fetching (top stories), web search integration, data processing, and structured output formatting. Step 3: MCP Context Evaluation - The context shows Agno Agent initialization with OpenAIChat and DuckDuckGoTools (first example), and Hacker News API usage with Firebase (second example). However, critical gaps exist: (1) No clear integration pattern between Hacker News fetching and web search tools, (2) Missing details on how to filter for 'AI tools' specifically vs general top stories, (3) No examples showing structured output generation with bullet points and risk notes, (4) Unclear how to cross-check Hacker News results with web coverage. While the context shows isolated components (Agno setup + HN API), it doesn't provide enough information to reliably implement the complete workflow. Step 4: Decision - INCOMPLETE because while the context is relevant and shows some foundational pieces, it lacks the integrated implementation guidance needed to fulfill all user requirements without substantial guessing."

      "overall_score": 5,
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - Build a trend scout agent using the Agno Python framework specifically. Find top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News (HN) currently. Cross-check with latest web coverage. Output a tight brief with 3 bullet takeaways, links (HN + news), and 1-sentence risk note per tool. Explicit constraint: Must use Agno Python framework.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - The oracle would likely use Agno's Agent class for the agent, OpenAIChat for the model, DuckDuckGoTools for web search/cross-checking, and a custom tool (e.g., fetch_top_hacker_news_stories) for HN data retrieval via Firebase API. Parameters include model ID (string), tools (list), markdown/debug_mode (booleans). Returns include JSON-structured story data (e.g., title, url). Usage involves initializing Agent and calling run() with a query. Error handling via try-except for requests.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For building Agno agent: Context provides import statements (from agno.agent import Agent), initialization (Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id='gpt-4o-mini'), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()])), parameters (model as OpenAIChat object, tools as list, markdown/debug_mode as booleans), return from run() as response string, usage pattern (agent.run('query')), error handling not explicit but inferable. For HN fetching: Context has @tool-decorated function fetch_top_hacker_news_stories(top_n: int) using requests to Firebase API, parameters (top_n as int), returns JSON string of stories (list of dicts with title/url), usage via tool integration, error handling with try-except. For web cross-check: DuckDuckGoTools inferred for search, with usage in Agno Agent examples. For output formatting: Agent instructions can handle structured output like bullets/links/notes. All 6 checklist items inferable (e.g., 'from agno.agent import Agent' for names; 'top_n: int' for types; JSON dumps for returns; run() calls for patterns; try-except for errors).\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness is true because all requirements are addressable: Agno framework usage is directly shown, HN fetching tool is provided with full details, web search via DuckDuckGoTools is inferable, and output can be formatted via agent run; no guessing required as examples cover imports, params, returns, and usage. Relevance is true as context directly addresses Agno agents, HN tools, and web search for trend scouting. Overall score 5 for excellent coverage enabling confident implementation. Confidence high due to clear, direct code examples like 'agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-4o-mini\"), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()])' and HN fetch tool."
