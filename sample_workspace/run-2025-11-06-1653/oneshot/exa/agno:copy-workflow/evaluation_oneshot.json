      "reasoning": "Step 1: User requirements\n- Build with Agno Python framework’s workflow system (explicit: use Agno Workflow/Steps)\n- Deterministic execution (e.g., temperature=0/seed; reproducibility)\n- From a spec, generate a short landing page: headline, 3 benefits, CTA; crisp, product‑led style\n- Then produce a Spanish translation of that copy\n- Show step outputs (per‑step results visible)\n\nStep 2: Oracle implementation (inferred, as oracle code not provided)\n- Likely uses agno.workflow (v2) with Steps/Step and Workflow to chain two steps: generate_copy and translate\n- Uses agno.agent.Agent for a copywriter agent and a translator agent\n- Sets deterministic model params (temperature=0 and possibly a seed) via Agno model wrapper\n- Executes workflow, captures and prints or returns per‑step outputs\n\nStep 3: MCP context coverage vs requirements\n1) Use Agno workflow system\n- Evidence present but incomplete:\n  • “from agno.workflow.v2 import Steps, Step, Workflow” and example Steps(... steps=[Step(name=\"research\", agent=researcher), Step(name=\"writing\", agent=writer), Step(name=\"editing\", agent=editor)]) (agno cookbook/workflows_2/README). The snippet is truncated and does not show how to execute or pass data between steps.\n  • “class BeginnerArticleWorkflow(Workflow)” (BitDoze article) shows subclassing Workflow and composing Agents, but no runnable method signature or invocation examples.\n- Missing: clear API for executing a Workflow (e.g., workflow.run(input)), how inputs/outputs are wired between Steps, and how to retrieve final and per‑step outputs.\n\n2) Deterministic execution\n- Missing in Agno context: How to set temperature or seed on Agno models. The OpenRouter model usage shows args {\"id\", \"api_key\", \"max_tokens\"} but no temperature/seed (BitDoze article). Non‑Agno snippets mention temperature (e.g., provider: openai, model: gpt‑4.1, temperature: 0.7), but that’s not Agno. A GenSX example shows deterministic patterns but is unrelated to Agno.\n- Therefore, determinism cannot be implemented confidently within Agno from the provided context.\n\n3) Generate landing page components (headline, 3 benefits, CTA) in a crisp, product‑led style\n- Partially supported: The BitDoze example shows how to construct Agents with instructions and response_model, indicating where prompts can be specified. So authoring prompts for copy is feasible. However, no Agno example shows enforcing a specific JSON schema for these fields or how Agent returns are structured without a response_model definition tailored to this task.\n\n4) Spanish translation step\n- Conceptually supported by composing another Agent with translation instructions (BitDoze Agent patterns). But chaining the first step’s output into the translator via Workflow is not documented in the retrieved Agno snippets.\n\n5) Show step outputs\n- The BitDoze file imports agno.run.response.RunEvent, RunResponse, implying evented runs, but no example of capturing or printing per‑step outputs.\n- Steps/Workflow v2 snippet is truncated before any execution or output inspection example.\n\nChecklist assessment\n- API/function names: Partially. We have Agent, Workflow, Steps, Step names, but no execution methods or signatures.\n- Parameter types/names: Partially for Agent construction (model args, instructions, response_model). Not for Workflow execution or data passing between steps.\n- Return values: Not documented for Workflow; Agent returns with response_model are implied but not shown for this specific task.\n- Usage patterns: Missing for executing a Workflow and observing step outputs.\n- Error handling: Minimal (“Errors during execution will raise Exceptions” in a docstring), no concrete handling patterns.\n\nStep 4: Decision\n- Completeness: INCOMPLETE. Critical pieces are missing: how to execute Agno workflows, pass data between steps, enforce determinism (temperature/seed) in Agno, and capture/show step outputs.\n- Relevance: TRUE. The context includes Agno Workflow/Agent snippets directly related to the task, though insufficient.\n\nEvidence quotes\n- Agno workflow v2: “from agno.workflow.v2 import Steps, Step, Workflow … steps=[ Step(name=\"research\", agent=researcher), Step(name=\"writing\", agent=writer), Step(name=\"editing\", agent=editor), ]” (cookbook/workflows_2/README). Truncated; no execution example.\n- Workflow subclassing with Agents: “class BeginnerArticleWorkflow(Workflow): … researcher: Agent … writer: Agent … editor: Agent” and Agents constructed with OpenRouter model (BitDoze article). No run/invoke shown.\n- Model args lack determinism: “model=OpenRouter(**common_model_args)” where common_model_args = {\"id\": model_id, \"api_key\": api_key, \"max_tokens\": max_tokens} (BitDoze). No temperature/seed.\n- Evented runs implied but undocumented: “from agno.run.response import RunEvent, RunResponse” (BitDoze), no usage shown.\n\nOverall: The MCP context is relevant but lacks the critical Agno workflow execution, determinism, and step output APIs needed to implement the oracle code confidently."

      "reasoning": "Step 1 - User Requirements Analysis: The user wants to build a deterministic copy generation workflow using Agno Python framework's workflow system that takes a spec as input and produces: (1) a short landing page with headline, 3 benefits, and CTA, (2) a Spanish translation, while maintaining crisp and product-led style and showing step outputs. Requirements include deterministic execution, workflow system usage, content generation, and translation functionality. Step 2 - Oracle Implementation Analysis: The oracle would need Agno workflow APIs, content generation agents, translation agents, step output display, and deterministic execution patterns. Step 3 - MCP Context Coverage Evaluation: The context shows multiple examples of prompt chaining and workflow patterns but lacks specific Agno framework API details. While it contains general workflow concepts and prompt chaining examples, it does not provide the specific Agno Python framework API signatures, parameter types, return values, or usage patterns needed to implement a deterministic copy generation workflow. The context includes Agno imports and some workflow examples, but critical implementation details like specific function calls, parameter passing, error handling, and deterministic execution patterns are missing. The examples shown are from various frameworks and approaches but don't provide the concrete Agno-specific implementation details required. Step 4 - Decision: The context is insufficient because while it demonstrates workflow concepts, it lacks the specific Agno framework API details needed to implement the requested functionality without guessing. Critical information about function signatures, parameter types, return structures, and deterministic workflow patterns in Agno cannot be reliably inferred."

      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - Build a deterministic workflow using Agno Python framework's workflow system. Input: A spec. Output: Short landing page copy (headline, 3 benefits, CTA) then Spanish translation. Style: Crisp, product-led. Process: Deterministic, show step outputs. Explicit constraints: Use Agno Python framework's workflow system.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - Uses Agno APIs like Workflow class, Agent class, OpenRouter model, tools (DuckDuckGoTools, Crawl4aiTools). Parameters include name, model, tools, instructions, response_model (Pydantic models like ResearchSummary, ArticleOutline, SectionDraft). Return types are inferred as agent responses or workflow runs yielding outputs (e.g., RunEvent, RunResponse). Usage patterns include initializing Workflow with agents for sequential tasks (research, outline, write sections, edit). Error handling via exponential_backoff=True. The code defines a multi-agent workflow for content generation, which aligns with copy creation and translation.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For 'using Agno workflow system': Context provides direct code example (beginner_article_workflow_streamlit.py) showing import agno.workflow, class BeginnerArticleWorkflow(Workflow), initialization with agents, parameters (e.g., api_key, model_id, max_tokens, tools=[DuckDuckGoTools, Crawl4aiTools]), return structures via Pydantic models, usage as sequential agent steps. For 'deterministic copy generation': Context has prompt chaining examples for marketing copy and translation (e.g., <step as=\"marketing_copy\"> with system/user prompts, temperature=0.7 inferable to 0 for determinism). For 'produce landing page (headline, benefits, CTA) and Spanish translation': Context includes translation steps (e.g., <step as=\"translation\">, TRANSLATE_TEMPLATE to Spanish), inferable parameters (content, target_language), returns as translated copy. For 'style crisp/product-led': Inferable from prompt instructions in context (e.g., tone, length). For 'show step outputs': Context shows workflow steps yielding outputs (e.g., research → outline → writer → editor). All 6 checklist items inferable: API names (Workflow, Agent), param types/names (str for api_key, dict for model_args), returns (JSON via response_model), usage (sequential agent init and run), error handling (exponential_backoff).\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness=true because all requirements are addressable; context provides full inference for APIs, params, returns, usage without guessing (e.g., evidence: 'self.researcher=Agent(name=\"TechResearcherBeginnerFocus\", model=OpenRouter(**common_model_args), tools=[...], instructions=dedent(\"\"\"...\"\"\"), response_model=ResearchSummary)'). Relevance=true as context directly covers Agno workflows for copy generation/translation. No explicit constraints unmet; adaptation from article to landing page is feasible with provided patterns."
