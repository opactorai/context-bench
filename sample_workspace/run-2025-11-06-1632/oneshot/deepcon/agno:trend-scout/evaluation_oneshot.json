      "reasoning": "Step 1 – User requirements\n- Build a trend scout agent using the Agno Python framework\n- Retrieve top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News “right now”\n- Cross‑check each with latest web coverage\n- Produce a tight brief containing: 3 bullet takeaways, links (HN + news), and a 1‑sentence risk note per tool\n- Implicit: runnable example, guidance on setup, web search and article parsing capabilities\n\nStep 2 – Oracle implementation details\n- Uses Agno classes: Agent, Team, OpenAIChat\n- Tools: HackerNewsTools(), DuckDuckGoTools(), Newspaper4kTools()\n- Composition: Three Agents (HN Researcher, Web Searcher, Article Reader) orchestrated by a Team\n- Output schema: Pydantic BaseModel (Brief) with fields bullet, hn_link, coverage_link, risk_note (all str)\n- Invocation: hn_team.print_response(prompt)\n- Model: OpenAIChat(\"gpt-5-mini\")\n- Installation and setup: pip install agno ddgs newspaper4k lxml_html_clean; export OPENAI_API_KEY\n- Instructions drive behavior (top 3 by score, get HN link, search recent coverage, read article, produce take‑away and risk note)\n\nStep 3 – MCP context coverage vs. requirements\n1) API/function names\n- Clearly provided: Agent, Team, OpenAIChat, HackerNewsTools, DuckDuckGoTools, Newspaper4kTools, print_response. Evidence: code block shows imports and instantiation (e.g., from agno.agent import Agent; hn_team = Team(...); hn_team.print_response(...)).\n\n2) Parameter types, names, purposes\n- Agent parameters shown: name (str), model (OpenAIChat), role (str), tools (list), add_datetime_to_context (bool). Evidence: web_searcher Agent sets add_datetime_to_context=True.\n- Team parameters shown: name (str), model, members (list[Agent]), instructions (list[str]), output_schema (Pydantic model), markdown (bool), show_members_responses (bool). Evidence: hn_team instantiation.\n- Tools require no constructor params in example. Evidence: HackerNewsTools(), DuckDuckGoTools(), Newspaper4kTools() used bare.\n- Output schema fields and purposes are documented inline. Evidence: Brief(BaseModel) with comments for take‑away, HN link, coverage link, risk note.\n\n3) Return values / structures\n- Output structure enforced by output_schema=Brief and described as “output as a markdown list.” Evidence: instructions[6] and narrative: “The `output_schema` (`Brief`) enforces a structured bullet...”\n- print_response usage pattern indicates it prints the response; return value not required by the oracle code (not captured). This is sufficient to replicate behavior.\n\n4) Usage patterns / examples\n- Full working script provided (trend_scout_agent.py) showing end‑to‑end assembly and execution. Evidence: provided code block, including main guard and prompt.\n- Installation and environment setup provided. Evidence: pip install commands and OPENAI_API_KEY export.\n\n5) Error handling\n- While explicit exception classes aren’t listed, the context provides concrete troubleshooting and recommended handling strategies (rate limits, parsing failures, link validation, try/except guidance). Evidence: Best Practices & Tips and Troubleshooting tables: “wrap each tool call in a try/except… fallback to ‘No recent coverage found’…”, “DuckDuckGo API rate‑limited…”, “newspaper4k failed…”. This is sufficient to implement pragmatic error handling aligned with the oracle functionality.\n\n6) Meeting explicit constraints\n- No user constraint on specific LLM model/version. The context uses OpenAIChat(\"gpt-5-mini\"). Installation notes include using OPENAI_API_KEY. No mismatch with user demands.\n\nStep 4 – Decision\n- Completeness: TRUE. The MCP context provides a complete, runnable implementation that matches the requested functionality and the oracle code structure. All required APIs, parameters, output structure, and usage patterns are inferable from the provided code and notes. Error handling guidance is present at a level sufficient to implement reasonable resilience for this agent.\n- Relevance: TRUE. The context is directly tailored to the “agno:trend-scout” scenario and implements exactly the trend scout agent described.\n\nQuoted evidence\n- “Code – Trend Scout Agent” full script with imports, Agent/Team setup, tools, and hn_team.print_response(...)\n- “The `output_schema` (`Brief`) enforces a structured bullet… take‑away, HN link, coverage link, risk note.”\n- “Installation: pip install agno ddgs newspaper4k lxml_html_clean; export OPENAI_API_KEY=****”\n- “Best Practices & Tips” and “Troubleshooting” sections describing error‑handling approaches and likely issues.\n\nConclusion: A developer can implement functionality equivalent to the oracle code based solely on the MCP context. Score: 5 (Excellent)."

Step 2: Oracle Implementation Analysis - The oracle code uses: HackerNewsTools() for fetching stories, DuckDuckGoTools() for web searching, Newspaper4kTools() for article parsing, and a Team structure for coordination with a Brief output schema. Step 3: MCP Context Coverage Evaluation - ALL requirements are addressed comprehensively: The context provides exact agent configurations with model specifications (OpenAIChat('gpt-5-mini')), detailed tool usage patterns showing how each tool integrates, complete parameter examples (add_datetime_to_context=True), clear output schema (Brief class with bullet, hn_link, coverage_link, risk_note), and step-by-step instructions for the team workflow. Specific evidence includes: Tool imports (HackerNewsTools, DuckDuckGoTools, Newspaper4kTools), agent setup with role definitions, team orchestration with detailed instructions, and working code template. Step 4: Decision - COMPLETE because every aspect of the oracle implementation can be reliably inferred from the context without guessing, including API usage, parameter handling, return structures, and error handling patterns mentioned in troubleshooting."

      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - The query requests building a trend scout agent using the Agno Python framework to: (1) find the top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News, (2) cross-check them with latest web coverage, (3) output a tight brief with 3 bullet takeaways, links (HN + news), and a 1-sentence risk note per tool. Explicit constraints: Must use Agno Python framework. Technical specifications: Involves fetching from Hacker News, web search for coverage, summarization, and structured output.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - The oracle code uses Agno's Agent, Team, OpenAIChat model ('gpt-5-mini'), HackerNewsTools, DuckDuckGoTools, and Newspaper4kTools. It defines a Brief BaseModel with fields like bullet, hn_link, coverage_link, risk_note. It creates three agents (HN Researcher, Web Searcher, Article Reader) with specific roles and tools, then a Team to orchestrate them with instructions for searching HN, selecting top 3 stories, web searching for coverage, extracting summaries/risks, and outputting via the Brief schema in markdown. Parameters include name, model, role, tools, instructions, output_schema, etc. Returns structured markdown output via team.print_response(). Error handling is mentioned in best practices and troubleshooting sections.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For requirement (1) (find top 3 AI tools from HN): Context provides HackerNewsTools() with usage in code (e.g., hn_researcher with tools=[HackerNewsTools()]) and instructions like 'Search Hacker News for the latest stories about emerging AI tools' and 'Return the top 3 stories (by score)'; infers API names, parameters (e.g., query implied in print_response), returns (stories with scores/links), usage (mirrors example in context). For (2) (cross-check with web coverage): Provides DuckDuckGoTools() and Newspaper4kTools() with code examples (e.g., web_searcher.tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], article_reader.tools=[Newspaper4kTools()]); instructions detail searching for coverage and extracting summary/risk; infers parameters (e.g., search queries), returns (links, summaries), usage from code. For (3) (structured output): Provides Brief schema, Team with output_schema=Brief, markdown=True; infers all fields, usage in code. All 6 checklist items are inferable: API names (e.g., Agent, Team, tools), parameter types/names/purposes (e.g., model=OpenAIChat(str), tools=list), return structures (Brief model), usage patterns (full code), error handling (troubleshooting table, best practices like try/except).\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness is true because the MCP context provides the exact oracle code, detailed explanations, and all necessary inferences for APIs, parameters, returns, and usage, fully addressing all requirements without guessing. Relevance is true as the context directly implements the requested functionality. Overall score 5: Excellent, as the context enables confident, complete implementation. Confidence high due to explicit code and documentation evidence.\n\nEvidence quotes: 'hn_researcher = Agent(name=\"HackerNews Researcher\", model=OpenAIChat(\"gpt-5-mini\"), role=\"Gets top AI-tool stories from Hacker News.\", tools=[HackerNewsTools()])' shows API usage; 'output_schema=Brief' defines returns; Troubleshooting table provides error handling like 'Add export DUCKDUCKGO_API_KEY=… or add time.sleep(1)'. No explicit constraints unmet (uses Agno framework as specified)."
