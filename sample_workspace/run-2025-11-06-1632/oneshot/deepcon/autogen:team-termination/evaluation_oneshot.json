      "reasoning": "Step 1 – User requirements\n- Build a multi-agent system using Autogen Python with teams and termination conditions.\n- Writer drafts a 6-line product tagline for a sustainable water bottle.\n- A critic must review and respond APPROVE; otherwise iterate until approved.\n- Automatically stop when a small turn budget is exceeded.\n- No explicit model/version constraints beyond using Autogen and termination.\n\nStep 2 – Oracle implementation details (from context)\n- Agents and models: AssistantAgent for writer and critic; shared OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o\").\n  Evidence: \"from autogen_ext.models.openai import OpenAIChatCompletionClient\" and \"model_client = OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model=\"gpt-4o\")\".\n- Team orchestration: RoundRobinGroupChat for fixed-order turn taking.\n  Evidence: \"from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat\" and usage \"team = RoundRobinGroupChat(agents=[writer, critic], termination_condition=termination)\".\n- Termination: MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=8) for small turn budget.\n  Evidence: \"from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination\" and \"termination = MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=8)\".\n- Behavior prompts:\n  - Writer instructed to produce exactly six lines and end with APPROVE only if satisfied.\n    Evidence: writer system_message: \"Write a six‑line product tagline… End the draft with the word `APPROVE` only if the tagline meets all requirements.\"\n  - Critic instructed to respond APPROVE if satisfied; otherwise provide feedback.\n    Evidence: critic system_message: \"If it satisfies the brief, respond with the single word `APPROVE`. Otherwise, give constructive feedback and ask the writer to try again.\"\n- Execution/streaming: team.run_stream(task=\"Generate the tagline.\") piped to Console for streaming.\n  Evidence: \"await Console(team.run_stream(task=\"Generate the tagline.\"))\".\n- Iteration logic: Round-robin cycles until critic says APPROVE or termination triggers.\n  Evidence: \"The Critic agent checks the Writer’s output for the keyword APPROVE… If the keyword is missing, the Critic asks for a rewrite, causing the loop to continue.\"\n\nStep 3 – MCP context coverage against checklist\n1) API/Function names: Provided explicitly.\n   - AssistantAgent, RoundRobinGroupChat, MaxMessageTermination, OpenAIChatCompletionClient, Console, team.run_stream.\n2) Parameter types and purposes: Inferable from code and narrative.\n   - AssistantAgent(name: str, model_client: OpenAIChatCompletionClient, system_message: str, model_client_stream: bool).\n   - MaxMessageTermination(max_messages: int) as a turn budget.\n   - RoundRobinGroupChat(agents: list[AssistantAgent], termination_condition=...).\n   - OpenAIChatCompletionClient(model: str).\n   Evidence: Direct code snippets in the Quick-Start Example.\n3) Return value structure: Sufficiently inferable for implementation via usage pattern.\n   - team.run_stream(...) returns a stream consumable by Console; the example shows how to call it and the expected conversational output structure (“Writer: …”, “Critic: APPROVE”).\n   Evidence: \"await Console(team.run_stream(task=\"Generate the tagline.\"))\" and the \"Full Tagline Example (Result)\" transcript.\n4) Usage patterns: Clearly demonstrated end-to-end with a runnable async main().\n   Evidence: Full async example with setup, creation, termination, orchestration, and run.\n5) Error handling: Operational safeguards and troubleshooting are provided.\n   - Turn-budget enforced via MaxMessageTermination; alternative terminations and fixes are described.\n   Evidence: Troubleshooting table and \"Common Patterns & Extensions\" (e.g., TokenUsageTermination, TextMentionTermination).\n   While explicit exception classes aren’t documented, the requirements do not mandate exception handling; termination-based control flow is covered.\n6) Explicit constraints: All user constraints are met.\n   - Autogen Python; Teams via RoundRobinGroupChat; Termination via MaxMessageTermination; 6-line tagline; critic APPROVE loop; small max_messages.\n\nStep 4 – Decision\n- Completeness: TRUE. The context gives a concrete, runnable example that matches every user requirement, with clear APIs, parameters, usage, and operational handling of termination/iteration. No guessing is required to implement equivalently.\n- Relevance: TRUE. The context directly addresses Autogen teams with termination and the critic-approval workflow for a 6-line tagline.\n- Overall: 5 (Excellent).\n\nNotes/Evidence link: Full context available at https://deepcon.ai/context/cmhnnbug1000bjr04f6ty9nbp"

      "reasoning": "The MCP context provides excellent coverage for implementing the oracle code. User requirements include: (1) multi-agent system with Autogen Python library, (2) teams and termination conditions, (3) 6-line product tagline generation, (4) critic review with APPROVE mechanism, (5) iteration until approval, (6) automatic stop with turn budget. The context contains a complete working example that directly addresses all requirements. It shows explicit imports for RoundRobinGroupChat and MaxMessageTermination, demonstrates AssistantAgent creation with proper parameters (name, model_client, system_message), shows termination condition setup with max_messages parameter, and provides the exact approval pattern with Writer and Critic roles. All API signatures, parameter types, return values, and usage patterns are clearly inferable from the detailed code example and explanatory text. The context even includes a successful workflow demonstration showing exactly how the approval mechanism works. No critical information is missing, and the example matches the user's requirements precisely."

      "completeness": true,
      "relevance": true,
      "overall_score": 5,
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - Build a multi-agent system using Autogen Python library with teams and termination conditions. Specific functionality: Draft a 6-line product tagline for a sustainable water bottle using an agent (Writer). Include a Critic agent that reviews and must APPROVE; otherwise iterate. Automatically stop if exceeding a small turn budget. Explicit constraints: Use Autogen Python library, teams (e.g., RoundRobinGroupChat), termination conditions (e.g., max messages), iteration until approval or budget exceeded. No specific model or version mentioned beyond Autogen.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - The oracle (Quick-Start Example in context) uses APIs like OpenAIChatCompletionClient (for model), AssistantAgent (for Writer and Critic with params: name, model_client, system_message, model_client_stream=True), RoundRobinGroupChat (params: agents=[writer, critic], termination_condition=MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=8)), MaxMessageTermination (param: max_messages), and Console(team.run_stream(task='Generate the tagline.')). It uses asyncio for running. Parameters are strings, booleans, lists, objects; returns are inferred from usage (e.g., run_stream streams conversation). Error handling is not explicitly shown but termination prevents infinite loops.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For multi-agent system with teams: Context provides RoundRobinGroupChat with agents list, usage in code example; infers API name, params (agents, termination_condition), returns (team object for running), patterns (team.run_stream(task=...)). For termination conditions: MaxMessageTermination with max_messages param; infers from code and explanation (e.g., 'stops after a given number of messages'). For drafting tagline: Writer's system_message in code shows how to instruct for 6-line tagline ending with APPROVE if ready. For Critic review and APPROVE/iterate: Critic's system_message in code; iteration via round-robin until termination; 'How It Works' explains approval logic. For small turn budget stop: MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=8) in code. All 6 checklist items inferable: API names from imports/code, param types/names from examples (e.g., max_messages=int), returns from usage, patterns from full example, error handling via termination.\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness = true because the MCP context provides a full code example and explanations that directly match all user requirements, allowing inference of all APIs, params, returns, and usage without guessing. Relevance = true as context directly implements the requested system. Overall score 5: Excellent, complete and clear. Confidence high based on explicit code and docs. Evidence quote: 'team = RoundRobinGroupChat(agents=[writer, critic], termination_condition=termination)' and system messages matching tagline/critic logic."
