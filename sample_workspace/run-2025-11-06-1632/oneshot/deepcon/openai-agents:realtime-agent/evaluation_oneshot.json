      "reasoning": "Step 1: User requirements\n- Use the OpenAI Agents Python SDK (openai-agents) with Realtime API support.\n- Start a voice concierge that listens and replies in real time.\n- Use the Realtime model with server-side VAD.\n- Log audio events to stdout only; do not use any audio input/output devices.\n\nStep 2: Oracle implementation details (as reflected by the provided example)\n- APIs used: from agents.realtime import RealtimeAgent, RealtimeRunner.\n- Instantiate a RealtimeAgent with name and instructions.\n- Configure RealtimeRunner with config['model_settings'] including:\n  - model_name: \"gpt-realtime\"\n  - voice: \"ash\"\n  - modalities: [\"audio\"]\n  - input_audio_format: \"pcm16\", output_audio_format: \"pcm16\"\n  - input_audio_transcription: {\"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini-transcribe\"}\n  - turn_detection: {\"type\": \"semantic_vad\", \"interrupt_response\": True}\n- Start session via session = await runner.run(), then async with session: async for event in session:\n- Event handling/logging for types: agent_start, agent_end, handoff, tool_start, tool_end, audio (len(event.data), event.timestamp), audio_end, audio_interrupted, raw_model_event, error.\n- Defensive try/except around event handling; environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY; troubleshooting guidance.\n\nStep 3: MCP context coverage against requirements (API signatures, params, returns, usage, errors)\n1) API/function names\n- Clearly specified: RealtimeAgent, RealtimeRunner, runner.run(), session as async iterator/context manager. Quote: \"from agents.realtime import RealtimeAgent, RealtimeRunner\" and \"session = await runner.run()\" and \"async with session: async for event in session\".\n\n2) Parameter types\n- Inferred from example and parameter table:\n  - config[\"model_settings\"] expects dict with string/list/bool keys: model_name (str), voice (str), modalities (list[str]), input_audio_format/output_audio_format (str), input_audio_transcription (dict with model str), turn_detection (dict with type str, interrupt_response bool).\n  - Event attributes: for audio, event.data (bytes) and event.timestamp (float). Quote: \"Audio chunk received – just log its length (bytes)\" and code: len(event.data), f\"(timestamp {event.timestamp:.3f}s)\".\n\n3) Parameter names/purposes\n- Explicitly documented in \"Important Parameters\" table with purposes: model_name = \"gpt-realtime\"; turn_detection.type = \"semantic_vad\"; input_audio_transcription sets server-side STT; modalities [\"audio\"]. Quote: \"Server‑side VAD – Set turn_detection.type to \\\"semantic_vad\\\"\" and the table entries.\n\n4) Return values/structures\n- Session yields events with types and attributes; example shows which attributes are available per type (e.g., event.agent.name, event.tool.name, event.output, event.data, event.error). Quote: \"The runner yields a stream of events (agent_start, audio, audio_end, raw_model_event, …).\" and code branches for each event type.\n\n5) Usage patterns\n- Full working async example provided, demonstrating instantiation, configuration, session lifecycle, and event loop logging. Quote: \"Minimal Working Example\" block showing the entire flow.\n\n6) Error handling\n- Provided: defensive try/except around event handling; troubleshooting for auth errors, version mismatch, and loop exceptions. Quotes: \"Defensive logging – ensures the loop keeps running\" and Troubleshooting table entries (e.g., \"AuthorizationError or 401\" → set OPENAI_API_KEY; version upgrade guidance).\n\nStep 4: Decision\n- Completeness: TRUE. All user requirements are directly addressed with clear API usage, parameters, return/event structures, and error handling. No guessing is necessary. The explicit constraints (Realtime model, server-side VAD, stdout logging, no audio devices) are satisfied: e.g., \"model_name\": \"gpt-realtime\"; \"turn_detection\": {\"type\": \"semantic_vad\"}; event logging for \"audio\"; and \"No microphone or speaker is accessed – the script only receives events from the model.\"\n- Relevance: TRUE. The context is precisely about building a realtime voice concierge with the OpenAI Agents Python SDK and server-side VAD, logging audio events to stdout without audio devices.\n\nAdditional note: The context link for reference is available at https://deepcon.ai/context/cmhnnejge000pjr04cxei9n8q if needed."

The example shows how to create a RealtimeAgent with instructions, configure a RealtimeRunner with the exact model settings requested (gpt-realtime model, semantic_vad VAD), start a session, and log all audio events to stdout without requiring audio devices. All API signatures, parameter types, return values, and usage patterns are clearly demonstrated through the comprehensive code example and documentation."

      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - Functionality: Start a voice concierge that listens and replies in real time using OpenAI Agents Python SDK with Realtime API support. Explicit constraints: Use Realtime model (gpt-realtime), server-side VAD (semantic_vad), log audio events to stdout, no audio device needed. Technical specifications: Asynchronous Python script, process and print events without hardware access.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - The oracle would use APIs like RealtimeAgent and RealtimeRunner from agents.realtime. Parameters include name and instructions for RealtimeAgent (strings); for RealtimeRunner, starting_agent (RealtimeAgent instance) and config (dict with model_settings including model_name='gpt-realtime', voice='ash', modalities=['audio'], input/output_audio_format='pcm16', input_audio_transcription={'model': 'gpt-4o-mini-transcribe'}, turn_detection={'type': 'semantic_vad', 'interrupt_response': True}). Return types: runner.run() returns an async session iterable yielding event objects with types like 'agent_start', 'audio', etc. Usage patterns: Async main function with asyncio.run, async with session for event looping, logging based on event.type. Error handling: Try-except in event loop for defensive logging.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For starting voice concierge with Realtime API: Context provides full code example using RealtimeAgent and RealtimeRunner, inferring API names, parameters (e.g., model_settings dict with exact keys/values), return structures (event objects with type and attributes like event.data for audio), usage (async run, event loop with logging). For Realtime model: Context specifies 'model_name': 'gpt-realtime' in config. For server-side VAD: 'turn_detection': {'type': 'semantic_vad', 'interrupt_response': True}. For logging audio events to stdout without audio device: Code logs events like 'audio' by length to print, explicitly notes no AudioInput/Output objects created. All 6 checklist items inferable: API names from imports/code; parameter types/names/purposes from example (e.g., strings, dicts); return values from event handling (e.g., event.type, event.data); usage from full script; error handling via try-except example.\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness = true because ALL requirements are addressable with no guessing; context provides direct, inferable info for APIs, params, returns, usage matching explicit constraints (e.g., 'gpt-realtime' and 'semantic_vad' explicitly covered). Relevance = true as context directly implements the query's functionality. Overall score 5: Excellent, full implementation possible confidently. Confidence high: Clear, comprehensive evidence in context.\n\nEvidence: Code example imports 'from agents.realtime import RealtimeAgent, RealtimeRunner'; config dict with 'model_name': 'gpt-realtime' and 'turn_detection': {'type': 'semantic_vad'}; event logging like 'print(f\"🔊 Audio chunk: {len(event.data)} bytes\")'; notes 'No microphone or speaker is accessed'."
