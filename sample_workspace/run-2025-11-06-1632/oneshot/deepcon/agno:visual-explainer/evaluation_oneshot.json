      "reasoning": "Step 1 – User requirements\n- Build a visual explainer agent using the Agno Python framework with image input.\n- On image input: (a) identify the landmark, (b) explain its significance, (c) pull the two latest news items related to it, (d) end with a 3‑point TL;DR and include links.\n- No explicit constraints on provider; model must support image input.\n\nStep 2 – Oracle implementation (from context)\n- Libraries/APIs: agno.agent.Agent, agno.media.Image, agno.models.openai.OpenAIChat (alternatives: agno.models.xai.xAI, agno.models.vercel.V0), agno.tools.duckduckgo.DuckDuckGoTools, optional agno.utils.media.download_image.\n- Agent creation: agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-5-mini\"), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], markdown=True)\n- Prompt enumerates the steps (identify, explain significance, fetch two news items with title/date/URL, end with 3‑point TL;DR): “You are a visual journalist. For the supplied image: 1️⃣ Identify the landmark… 2️⃣ Explain… 3️⃣ Retrieve the two most recent news items… 4️⃣ End with a 3‑point TL;DR… Only output markdown. Cite sources with proper links.”\n- Image submission: agent.print_response(prompt, images=[Image(url=\"…\")], stream=True) or images=[Image(content=image_bytes)] after reading bytes.\n- Tooling: tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()] to enable web/news search; usage is automatic via tool calls.\n- Expected output: Markdown with landmark section, significance paragraph, two news items (title/date/URL), and a 3‑point TL;DR (example provided).\n- Error handling guidance: “Wrap agent.print_response in a try/except block to catch network or model errors.”\n\nStep 3 – MCP context coverage vs. requirements\n1) Use Agno with image input\n- API/function names: Agent, Image, OpenAIChat/V0/xAI, agent.print_response. Example: “from agno.agent import Agent … from agno.media import Image … agent = Agent(…) … agent.print_response(…, images=[Image(url=…)], stream=True).”\n- Parameters/types: Image(url=str) or Image(content=bytes); Agent(model=…, tools=[…], markdown=bool); print_response(prompt=str, images=list[Image], stream=bool). Evidence: “Image(url=…)” and “Image(content=image_bytes)”.\n- Return values: print_response streams/prints response; expected formatted markdown shown under “Expected Output Format”.\n- Usage patterns: Complete example script (visual_explainer.py) and step‑by‑step snippets.\n- Error handling: Best practices recommend try/except around print_response.\n\n2) Identify the landmark\n- Vision model capability: “OpenAI Chat (gpt‑5‑mini) – works with image input” and alternatives “grok‑2‑vision‑latest”, “v0‑1.0‑md”.\n- Prompt explicitly requires identification. The agent wiring and example show how to do it with images=[Image(...)] and a vision‑capable model.\n\n3) Explain its significance\n- Prompt dictates a short paragraph on historical/cultural significance; usage pattern is clear in the provided prompt.\n\n4) Pull two latest news items related to the landmark\n- Tooling: DuckDuckGoTools provided via tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]. Evidence: “Enables web/news search.”\n- Usage pattern: “DuckDuckGoTools automatically returns the top result; request two items in the prompt and the model will call the tool twice.” The agent manages the calls; developer does not need direct method signatures.\n- Parameters/returns: Not directly invoked by user code; integrated into the agent’s tool‑calling flow. Expected final output shows title/date/URL formatting, so the return structure for the end‑user is inferable.\n\n5) End with a 3‑point TL;DR and links\n- Prompt enforces a 3‑point TL;DR and “Only output markdown. Cite sources with proper links.” Expected output example demonstrates compliance.\n\nChecklist assessment\n- API/function names: Yes (Agent, Image, model classes, DuckDuckGoTools, print_response, download_image, run).\n- Parameter types/names/purposes: Yes (e.g., Image(url) vs Image(content=bytes), model id strings, tools list, markdown flag, stream flag, images list).\n- Return values: Sufficient for implementation—the final output is printed markdown; example shows structure. Tool return internals are abstracted by Agent and not required for this use.\n- Usage patterns: Yes (full working example and multiple snippets).\n- Error handling: Yes (explicit guidance to wrap in try/except).\n\nDecision\n- Completeness: COMPLETE (true). All user requirements can be implemented with the provided context; APIs, parameters, return behaviors, and usage patterns are inferable without guessing.\n- Relevance: High—context directly addresses building a visual explainer agent with image input, landmark identification, news retrieval, and TL;DR with links.\n\nEvidence quotes\n- “agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-5-mini\"), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], markdown=True)”\n- “agent.print_response(prompt, images=[Image(url=\"…\")], stream=True)”\n- “Image(content=image_bytes)”\n- “You are a visual journalist… Retrieve the two most recent news items… End with a 3‑point TL;DR… Only output markdown. Cite sources with proper links.”\n- “DuckDuckGoTools automatically returns the top result; request two items in the prompt and the model will call the tool twice.”\n- “Wrap agent.print_response in a try/except block to catch network or model errors.”\n\nNote: The context link for reference: https://deepcon.ai/context/cmhnnapbb0009jr04h97z8pny"

      "completeness": true,
      "relevance": true,
      "overall_score": 5,
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - The query requests building a visual explainer agent using the Agno Python framework with image input capabilities. Specific functionality: Upon receiving an image, (1) identify the landmark (name and location), (2) explain its historical/cultural significance in a short paragraph, (3) retrieve the two most recent news items (including title, date, and URL), (4) end with a 3-point TL;DR summary, and (5) include links/sources. Explicit constraints: Must use Agno Python framework and support image input. No specific model or version is mandated beyond vision-capable models.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - Assuming the oracle code is the ideal implementation fulfilling the query, it would involve: (1) Importing Agno components like Agent, Image, a vision-capable model (e.g., OpenAIChat), and DuckDuckGoTools. (2) Creating an Agent instance with a model (e.g., OpenAIChat(id='gpt-5-mini')), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], and markdown=True. (3) Defining a prompt that instructs the agent on the steps (identify landmark, explain significance, fetch news, provide TL;DR). (4) Calling agent.print_response() with the prompt and images (e.g., Image(url=...) or Image(content=bytes)). Parameters: model expects an ID string, tools is a list, images is a list of Image objects with url or content (bytes). Return: The method prints markdown-formatted response; no explicit return type but implies streaming output. Usage patterns include streaming (stream=True) and error handling recommendations.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For identifying landmark and explaining significance: Context provides API names (Agent, OpenAIChat, Image), parameters (model=id string like 'gpt-5-mini', images=list of Image with url/string or content=bytes), purposes (vision-capable model processes image to identify/explain), return structure (markdown response inferred from example output), usage (full code examples showing instantiation and print_response call), error handling (troubleshooting section on model support and try/except recommendation). For pulling latest news: Context covers DuckDuckGoTools() in tools list, prompt instructs tool use, usage patterns show model calls tool automatically, inferred parameters (tool called via prompt, returns title/date/URL), return structure from examples. For 3-point TL;DR and links: Handled via prompt engineering and markdown=True, with examples showing bullet-point format and links. All 6 checklist items are inferable: API names from imports/code, parameter types/names from examples (e.g., id='gpt-5-mini' as string, url as string), purposes from descriptions, returns from sample output, usage from full examples, errors from troubleshooting. No guessing required; explicit constraints (Agno with image input) are met with alternatives like xAI or Vercel.\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness is true because the MCP context provides comprehensive documentation, code examples, and inferences for all requirements, allowing full implementation without gaps or guesses. Relevance is true as the context directly matches the query's functionality using Agno. Overall score 5: Excellent, with clear, complete info enabling confident implementation. Confidence high based on explicit evidence like the full working example and step-by-step guide."
