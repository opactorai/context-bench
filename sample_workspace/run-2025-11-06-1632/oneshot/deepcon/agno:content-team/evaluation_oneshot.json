      "reasoning": "Step 1 – User requirements\n- Use the Agno Python framework with multi‑agent teams.\n- Create a content generation system for a stainless, eco‑friendly water bottle.\n- Team must produce: (a) a blog post outline, (b) 3–5 credible source links, (c) a final 1‑page markdown post.\n- Planner ensures a clear buyer persona.\n- Researcher provides credible sources.\n- Writer must cite the Researcher’s sources in the final markdown.\n\nStep 2 – Oracle implementation details (from context)\n- Core APIs: agno.agent.Agent, agno.team.Team, agno.models.openai.OpenAIChat, agno.tools.duckduckgo.DuckDuckGoTools.\n- Example agent definitions show parameters: name (str), role (str), model (OpenAIChat(id=str)), tools (list[Tool]), instructions (str), markdown (bool).\n- Team construction: Team(name=str, members=list[Agent], instructions=str, model=OpenAIChat, show_members_responses=bool); execution via content_team.print_response(task: str).\n- Research tool: DuckDuckGoTools() for web search.\n- Environment/setup: pip install agno openai ddgs; OPENAI_API_KEY expected.\n- Output patterns: Planner returns persona + outline (markdown), Researcher returns JSON list of {title, url, summary}, Writer outputs final markdown with inline citations [n] and bibliography.\n- Troubleshooting guidance for common errors (install, network, formatting), implying basic error‑handling approach.\n\nStep 3 – MCP context coverage against requirements\n1) Agno multi‑agent framework usage\n   - API/function names and usage are explicit: Agent(...), Team(...), OpenAIChat(id=...), DuckDuckGoTools().\n   - Example: “from agno.agent import Agent … from agno.team import Team … content_team.print_response(task)”.\n   - Parameters and purposes are clear from examples (e.g., markdown=True; tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]).\n   - Return/behavior: print_response streams/prints coordinated outputs; examples show staged outputs for each member.\n   - Usage pattern: Full scripts provided (agents.py, content_team.py, full_content_pipeline.py) showing end‑to‑end orchestration.\n\n2) Planner ensures buyer persona and outline\n   - Evidence: “Planner … instructions: ‘First, define a clear buyer persona … Then, create a structured outline … Return the persona and outline in markdown format.’”\n   - Parameters/returns: Persona and outline content is markdown text; usage via team context is documented: “Takes the outline as context (automatically passed by the team).”\n\n3) Researcher provides 3–5 credible sources\n   - Evidence: “Researcher … tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()] … ‘locate 3‑5 credible, up‑to‑date sources … Return a JSON list of objects with title, url, and a one‑sentence summary.’”\n   - API and parameters inferable: DuckDuckGoTools is plug‑and‑play; tool list is passed to Agent.\n   - Return value structure is explicit (JSON with title/url/summary).\n\n4) Writer cites researcher’s sources and produces 1‑page markdown\n   - Evidence: “Writer … ‘write a 1‑page blog post in markdown. Cite each source inline (e.g., [1]) and include a bibliography section at the end with full URLs. Ensure the tone matches the buyer persona defined by the Planner.’”\n   - Usage: Writer consumes planner and researcher outputs via team context.\n\n5) Orchestration and running the pipeline\n   - Evidence: Team defined with members=[planner, researcher, writer], instructions specifying the order; show_members_responses=True to inspect outputs; Run via content_team.print_response(task).\n   - Installation and model selection included (“pip install agno openai ddgs”, export OPENAI_API_KEY, OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-5-mini\")). No conflicting model constraints exist in the user query.\n\n6) Error handling / troubleshooting\n   - While explicit exception types aren’t shown, practical error‑handling guidance is provided:\n     - “No URLs returned by Researcher → Verify `pip install ddgs` … ensure outbound internet access.”\n     - “Writer cites wrong numbers → Make sure the Researcher’s instructions force JSON … add a validation step.”\n     - “Team hangs or times‑out → Check API quota; consider smaller model.”\n   - This is sufficient to implement and debug the oracle functionality without guessing low‑level exceptions.\n\nDecision – Complete\n- All user requirements are met with concrete, runnable examples. API signatures, parameter purposes, return structures, and usage patterns are clear. Troubleshooting provides adequate error‑handling guidance for the scenario.\n- Quotes/evidence:\n  - “Planner … define a clear buyer persona … create a structured outline … Return the persona and outline in markdown.”\n  - “Researcher … locate 3‑5 credible … Return a JSON list of objects with `title`, `url`, and a one‑sentence `summary`.”\n  - “Writer … write a 1‑page blog post in markdown. Cite each source inline (e.g., [1]) and include a bibliography … Ensure the tone matches the buyer persona.”\n  - “content_team = Team(… members=[planner, researcher, writer] …); content_team.print_response(task)”\n  - Troubleshooting items as above.\n\nConclusion: The MCP context is sufficient to implement functionality equivalent to the oracle code.

User requirements were: (1) Create a multi-agent team with Planner, Researcher, and Writer roles using Agno framework, (2) Produce a 1-page blog post with outline, 3-5 credible sources, and markdown content, (3) Writer must cite researcher's sources, (4) Planner must define buyer persona. The context contains detailed Agent class signatures with name, role, model, instructions, and tools parameters; Team class with members, instructions, and coordination logic; DuckDuckGoTools integration; exact implementation examples showing parameter types and usage patterns; and complete workflow explanation. All API signatures, parameter types, return structures can be reliably inferred from the multiple comprehensive code examples provided."

      "overall_score": 5,
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - The query requires building a content generation system using the Agno Python framework with multi-agent teams for a stainless, eco-friendly water bottle launch. Specific outputs: (a) outline, (b) 3-5 credible source links, (c) final markdown blog post. Explicit constraints: Planner ensures clear buyer persona; Writer cites Researcher's sources; Use Agno framework, multi-agent teams (Planner, Researcher, Writer roles); Researcher uses credible sources (implied web search); Output in markdown.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - The oracle would involve importing from agno (Agent, Team), agno.models.openai (OpenAIChat), agno.tools.duckduckgo (DuckDuckGoTools); Defining three Agents with parameters like name, role, model=OpenAIChat(id='gpt-5-mini'), instructions (specific to each role, including buyer persona for Planner, JSON output for Researcher, citations for Writer), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()] for Researcher, markdown=True; Creating a Team with members list, instructions for coordination, model, show_members_responses=True; Running team.print_response(task) to generate outputs. Parameters are strings, lists, booleans; Returns are inferred as agent responses printed or returned as strings/markdown/JSON.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For all requirements, the context provides full inference: (1) API names like Agent, Team, OpenAIChat, DuckDuckGoTools are explicitly listed with imports. (2) Parameter types inferable (e.g., name=str, role=str, model=OpenAIChat object, instructions=str, tools=list of tool objects, markdown=bool). (3) Parameter purposes clear from examples (e.g., instructions define agent behavior, tools enable search). (4) Return structures inferable (e.g., Planner returns markdown persona/outline, Researcher returns JSON list, Writer returns markdown with citations; Team print_response outputs all). (5) Usage patterns shown in full code examples, including assembly and running the team. (6) Error handling inferable from troubleshooting section (e.g., fixes for no URLs, wrong formats). Explicit constraints met: Context has exact instructions for buyer persona in Planner, citations in Writer, DuckDuckGo for sources.\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness=true because all requirements are fully addressable with no guessing; all checklist items inferable from detailed code examples and explanations. Relevance=true as context directly matches the query's scenario and oracle structure. Overall excellent quality with comprehensive, production-ready examples; no improvements needed. Confidence high due to direct evidence like quoted code snippets: e.g., 'planner = Agent(name=\"Planner\", role=\"Content strategist...\", instructions=\"You are a content planner. First, define a clear buyer persona...\")' and full team assembly."
