      "reasoning": "Step 1: User requirements\n- Use Agno Python workflow system (Agents, Steps, Workflow)\n- Build a deterministic copy generation workflow\n- Input: a product/spec\n- Output Step 1: short landing page copy with fields: headline, exactly 3 benefits, CTA\n- Output Step 2: Spanish translation of the landing page\n- Style: crisp, product-led\n- Deterministic process\n- Show step outputs\n\nStep 2: Oracle implementation (inferred)\n- Would define two agents (writer and translator) using agno.models.openai.OpenAIChat\n- Chain two steps in a Workflow (Step: generate_landing_page → Step: translate_to_spanish)\n- Likely enforce structure via Pydantic output_schema for deterministic structure (headline, benefits[3], cta)\n- Ensure determinism via model parameters (temperature=0 and possibly seed) or framework-level deterministic settings\n- Run the workflow and print per-step outputs (either via pprint_run_response or stream_events)\n\nStep 3: MCP context coverage versus requirements\n1) Agno workflow primitives\n- API/Function names: Present. Step, Steps, Condition, Router, Workflow, Agent, OpenAIChat are shown across snippets (e.g., \"from agno.workflow.step import Step\", \"from agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow\").\n- Parameters: Examples show how to construct Agents and Steps (e.g., Step(name=\"writing\", agent=writer), Workflow(name=..., steps=[...])).\n- Usage patterns: Multiple end-to-end examples running workflows, both sync (print_response) and async (arun/aprint_response).\nEvidence: \"article_workflow = Workflow(... steps=[article_creation_sequence])\" and \"article_workflow.print_response(input=..., markdown=True)\"; \"workflow.aprint_response(..., stream=True, stream_events=True)\".\n\n2) Structured outputs for landing page fields\n- The context demonstrates using Pydantic models and Agent.output_schema to enforce structured outputs.\nEvidence: \"output_schema=SearchResults\" in BlogPostGenerator and Pydantic models defined (NewsArticle, SearchResults, ScrapedArticle). This is enough to infer how to define a LandingPage schema to constrain headline/benefits/cta.\n\n3) Spanish translation step\n- No direct translation example, but creating another Agent with instructions to translate is fully supported by shown API (Agent with instructions and OpenAIChat model). Step chaining is demonstrated throughout.\n\n4) Showing step outputs\n- Examples demonstrate printing/streaming results and events that imply step-by-step outputs.\nEvidence: \"pprint_run_response(result, markdown=True)\", and \"await workflow.aprint_response(..., stream=True, stream_events=True)\". The blog example shows run returning an Iterator[RunOutputEvent], which can be pretty-printed: \"blog_post: Iterator[RunOutputEvent] = generate_blog_post.run(...)\" followed by \"pprint_run_response(blog_post, markdown=True)\".\n- However, explicit programmatic access to each step’s output is not clearly documented; still, streaming events and pretty-printer likely suffice to \"show step outputs\" as requested.\n\n5) Determinism (critical requirement)\n- The context does not document how to make generation deterministic. There is no mention of temperature, top_p, seed, or any deterministic mode on OpenAIChat or Workflow.\n- Examples only pass model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-5-mini\"/\"gpt-4o-mini\"), with no parameters controlling randomness.\n- Caching (SqliteDb, use_cached_report) is shown but that addresses re-use, not determinism.\nEvidence: All model usages omit temperature/seed, e.g., \"model=OpenAIChat(id='gpt-5-mini')\"; no API reference to temperature/seed anywhere in the retrieved context.\n\n6) Error handling\n- One example demonstrates try/except around arun.\nEvidence: \"try: response: WorkflowRunOutput = await basic_workflow.arun(... ) except Exception as e: print(f'❌ Error: {e}')\".\n- This gives a minimal pattern, but no detailed error model is documented. Still, basic error handling can be inferred.\n\nStep 4: Decision\n- Missing critical information on how to make the process deterministic (temperature/seed or an equivalent deterministic mode). This is an explicit user requirement and cannot be reliably implemented without guessing parameter names/availability.\n- Other aspects (defining agents/steps/workflow, enforcing structure via output_schema, chaining translation, and showing outputs) are well covered.\n\nConclusion\n- Completeness: False — determinism configuration is not documented; would require guessing (e.g., temperature=0 or seed), violating the rules.\n- Relevance: True — the context directly addresses Agno workflows, steps, agents, structured outputs, and printing/streaming results.\n- Overall score: 3 (Average) — substantial coverage but a critical gap on determinism prevents full implementation without assumptions."

ORACLE EXPECTATION: Would use Workflow class with sequential steps for copy generation followed by translation. MCP CONTEXT COVERAGE: The context provides comprehensive Agno workflow documentation including: - Complete Workflow class definition with name, description, steps parameters - Step class with agent, name, description parameters - Sequential workflow patterns with multiple steps chained together - Agent creation with model configuration (OpenAIChat) - Deterministic execution patterns with explicit step sequencing - Step output display using print_response and pprint_run_response - Specific examples showing text generation workflows (article creation, blog post generator) - Translation capability inference from multilingual AI models. All required APIs (Workflow, Step, Agent, OpenAIChat), parameter types, return values, and usage patterns are clearly demonstrated in the examples. The context shows deterministic step-by-step execution and output display that perfectly matches the user's requirements for a copy generation workflow with translation."

      "overall_score": 3,
      "confidence": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - The query requests building a deterministic copy generation workflow using the Agno Python framework's workflow system. Specific functionality: Take a 'spec' as input, generate a short landing page (headline, 3 benefits, CTA) in a crisp, product-led style, then produce a Spanish translation. The process must be deterministic and show step outputs. Explicit constraints: Use Agno framework, ensure determinism, display step outputs; no specific models or versions mentioned beyond Agno.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - Since no explicit oracle code is provided, the oracle would likely involve importing from agno (e.g., Agent, Step, Steps, Workflow, OpenAIChat), defining agents for copy generation and translation (using OpenAIChat models with instructions for English generation and Spanish translation), chaining them in sequential Steps, creating a Workflow, and running it with a method like print_response to show outputs. For determinism, it would use parameters like temperature=0 or seed in the model (e.g., OpenAIChat). Parameters: Agent(name, model, instructions); Step(name, agent, description); Steps(steps=list); Workflow(name, description, steps); run/input methods. Returns: Workflow outputs structured responses (e.g., via print_response showing step-by-step results).\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For generating landing page copy: Context provides inferable info on Agent (name, model=OpenAIChat(id), instructions), Step (name, agent, description), Steps for sequencing, Workflow (name, description, steps), and running with print_response (e.g., from 'Define and run a sequential workflow using Agno Steps' example, which chains research, writing, editing). Parameter types (e.g., strings, lists, objects) and purposes are inferable from examples; return structures (e.g., workflow outputs) from print_response usage. Usage patterns for sequential content generation are clear. For Spanish translation: Inferable by defining another Agent with translation instructions (similar to writer/editor agents in examples), as no specific translation tool is needed—agents handle text tasks via instructions. For showing step outputs: Inferable from print_response(markdown=True) in multiple examples, which displays outputs. For determinism: Not inferable; context shows OpenAIChat(id='gpt-5-mini') but no parameters like temperature or seed (e.g., no examples set temperature=0). Error handling not explicitly shown but inferable from try/except in some examples.\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness is false because determinism (a key requirement) cannot be reliably inferred—no evidence on setting model parameters like temperature or seed in OpenAIChat, requiring guessing. All other aspects (agents, steps, sequencing, running, outputs) are inferable, but this critical gap means not all requirements are addressable. Relevance is true as context directly covers Agno workflows for content generation. Overall score 3: Average, with strong coverage of core workflow but significant gap in determinism. Confidence medium due to clear examples for most parts but ambiguity on model parameters."
