      "reasoning": "Step 1 – User requirements:\n- Use the Agno Python framework with image input capabilities.\n- Build a visual explainer agent that, upon receiving an image: (a) identifies the landmark, (b) explains its significance, (c) retrieves the two latest news items related to it, and (d) ends with a 3‑point TL;DR and links.\n- No explicit constraints on specific model/vendor; must support image input and web/news search.\n\nStep 2 – Oracle implementation (inferred):\n- Likely uses agno.Agent, agno.media.Image, a multimodal-capable model (e.g., OpenAIChat/Claude/Gemini), and a web search tool (DuckDuckGoTools or GoogleSearchTools/BraveSearchTools).\n- Runs with agent.print_response(...) or agent.run(...), passing images=[Image(...)] and a prompt/instructions enforcing: identify landmark, explain significance, fetch exactly two latest news with links, end with a 3-point TL;DR.\n- Parameters: Agent(model=..., tools=[...], instructions/description, markdown=True, stream=True). Image(url=...) or Image(content=bytes, format=...).\n- Returns: agent.run(...) -> response object with .content (and sometimes .images, .input.images). agent.print_response(...) streams output (return value not shown).\n- Error handling: not demonstrated in provided context.\n\nStep 3 – MCP context coverage by requirement:\n1) Agno agent with image input\n- API/function names: Agent, Image, OpenAIChat/Claude/Gemini, DuckDuckGoTools/GoogleSearchTools/etc. Examples: “agent.print_response(..., images=[Image(url=...)], stream=True)” (multiple snippets, e.g., OpenAIChat + DuckDuckGoTools; GoogleSearchTools; xAI; Gemini; Bedrock).\n- Parameter types/names/purposes: Image(url=...), Image(content=bytes, format=\"jpeg\"), Image(filepath=Path) are shown. Examples: Image(url=...), Image(content=image_bytes, format=\"jpeg\"), Image(filepath=image_path). Agent(model=..., tools=[...], markdown=True). Usage is clear.\n- Return values/usage: agent.run(...) returns response.content (e.g., “response1 = agent.run(...); response1.content”), and shows response.images and response.input.images in the image tool example. agent.print_response(...) streams output.\n- Usage patterns: Clearly shown across multiple snippets; also “agent.run(\"...\", images=[Image(url=...)])” in “Pass Images to Agno Agent Run in Python”.\n- Error handling: Not documented.\n\n2) Identify landmark and explain significance\n- Achievable via multimodal analysis prompts; multiple examples use prompts like “Tell me about this image” while passing an image (e.g., OpenAIChat, Claude, Gemini). The “Define and Run Image Analysis AI Agent” includes strong narrative/instruction patterns, showing how to enforce analysis style and structure via instructions.\n- No special API beyond prompt/instructions; usage covered.\n\n3) Pull the two latest news items related to it\n- Tools: DuckDuckGoTools and GoogleSearchTools are integrated in several examples (e.g., “tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]”, “tools=[GoogleSearchTools()]”). Examples explicitly ask for latest news: “Tell me about this image and give me the latest news about it.”\n- Parameter/return signatures for the search tools aren’t shown, but Agno’s tool invocation is delegated to the agent/model; usage pattern is adding the tool to the Agent. The “BraveSearchTools” example shows enforcing a specific number of news items via instructions: “respond with 4 latest news items” (demonstrates controllability by instruction), implying we can adjust to “2 latest news items”.\n- Error handling for search failures or empty results is not documented.\n\n4) End with a 3‑point TL;DR and links\n- Achievable via Agent instructions; the “Define and Run Image Analysis AI Agent” shows extensive instruction blocks to control style and structure. The BraveSearch example demonstrates including specific counts; links are typically included by search tools/models, but no explicit return structure is guaranteed.\n- No API-level enforcement; relies on instructions and model behavior.\n\nChecklist assessment:\n- API/function names: Yes (Agent, Image, model classes, tools; agent.run/print_response). Evidence: multiple code blocks, e.g., “from agno.agent import Agent … agent.print_response(…, images=[Image(url=…)] , stream=True)”.\n- Parameter types: Yes (Image url/content/filepath; Agent constructor fields; stream flag). Evidence: Bedrock example with Image(content=image_bytes, format=\"jpeg\"); Mistral example with Image(filepath=path).\n- Parameter names/purposes: Yes (images list, stream, markdown, tools, instructions). Evidence across examples.\n- Return value structure: Partially. agent.run returns an object with .content and sometimes .images/.input.images (shown in the “image_input_for_tool” example). agent.print_response streams output (no return type described). Sufficient to implement typical usage but not fully specified.\n- Usage patterns: Yes, thoroughly demonstrated in many snippets.\n- Error handling: No. There is no documentation or examples on exceptions, tool errors, image loading errors, or how to handle failures.\n\nDecision:\n- Completeness: False. While the context is highly relevant and provides enough patterns to implement a working agent that meets the user’s functional goals via instructions, it lacks explicit guidance on error handling and provides no concrete API surface for search tool methods or error contracts. Per the evaluation rules, missing error handling details means critical information cannot be reliably inferred.\n- Relevance: True. The context directly targets Agno multimodal agents, image inputs, and news retrieval via search tools, including examples closely matching the requested behavior.\n\nCited evidence:\n- “agent.print_response( 'Tell me about this image and give me the latest news about it.', images=[Image(url='https://…GoldenGateBridge-001.jpg')], stream=True )” (multiple examples: OpenAIChat, OpenAIResponses, xAI, Gemini, Bedrock, Mistral).\n- “agent.run( input='…', images=[sample_image] ) … response1.content” and references to response.images/input.images in “Image Input and Processing for Agno AI Tools in Python”.\n- “tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]”, “tools=[GoogleSearchTools()]”, “tools=[BraveSearchTools()]” with instruction-based control over number of items (“respond with 4 latest news items”).\n- “agent.run('…', images=[Image(url='https://example.com/image.jpg')])” showing minimal run pattern with image input."

      "reasoning": "1. List of user requirements: The query requests building a visual explainer agent using the Agno Python framework with image input capabilities. Specific functionality includes: identifying a landmark in a sent image, explaining its significance, pulling the two latest news items related to it, ending with a 3-point TL;DR and links. Explicit constraints: Must use Agno Python framework and support image input.\n\n2. Oracle's implementation details: The oracle code would likely use Agno APIs to create an Agent instance, configure it with a model (e.g., OpenAIChat or similar), integrate search tools (e.g., DuckDuckGoTools for news retrieval), set custom instructions for landmark identification, significance explanation, news pulling (specifically two items), TL;DR, and links. It would handle image input via agno.media.Image (using URL, bytes, or filepath), and run the agent with a prompt and images. Parameters would include model ID, tools list, instructions string, markdown=True. Return types would be the agent's response object with content. Usage patterns involve agent.print_response or agent.run with stream=True for output.\n\n3. For each requirement: \n- Building agent with Agno and image input: Context provides multiple examples of Agent initialization with models and image handling (e.g., Image(url=...), Image(content=...), Image(filepath=...)). API signatures like Agent(model=..., tools=..., markdown=True) are shown. Parameters (e.g., model as OpenAIChat(id='gpt-5-mini'), tools as [DuckDuckGoTools()]) and purposes are inferable from examples. Return is an Agent instance. Usage patterns: Many snippets show creating and running the agent with images.\n- Identify landmark and explain significance: Context has examples with instructions for visual analysis (e.g., 'Visual Analysis: Start with an attention-grabbing headline... Break down key visual elements...'). This can be adapted in the agent's instructions parameter, as shown in examples.\n- Pull two latest news items: Context integrates search tools like DuckDuckGoTools, GoogleSearchTools, BraveSearchTools for news retrieval. Examples show prompting for 'latest news about it' and using tools to fetch. Instructions can specify 'two latest news items' as in examples limiting to '4 latest news items'.\n- End with 3-point TL;DR and links: This can be specified in the agent's instructions parameter, as context shows custom instructions for response structure (e.g., 'Keep responses concise... End with a memorable sign-off'). Links would come from search tools' returns, inferable from examples.\nAll 6 checklist items (API names, param types/names/purposes, return structures, usage, error handling) are inferable: e.g., no explicit error handling in examples, but basic usage assumes success; param types like list of Image objects are clear.\n\n4. Clear decision: Complete (true) because ALL requirements are addressable with inferable details from context examples. No guessing needed; explicit Agno framework and image input are directly covered. Relevance is true as context focuses on Agno agents for image analysis and news retrieval.\n\n5. Quote specific examples from context as evidence: 'agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id=\"gpt-5-mini\"), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], markdown=True,)' for agent setup; 'agent.print_response(\"Tell me about this image and give me the latest news about it.\", images=[Image(url=\"...\")], stream=True,)' for image input and news; 'instructions=dedent(\"\"\"... Visual Analysis: ... News Integration: ...\"\"\"),' for custom instructions; 'tools=[BraveSearchTools()],' for alternative search tools."
