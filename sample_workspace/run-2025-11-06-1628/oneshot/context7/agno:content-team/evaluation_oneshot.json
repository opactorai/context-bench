      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements\n- Use Agno Python framework with multi-agent teams\n- Build a content generation system for a stainless, eco-friendly water bottle launch\n- Team deliverables (in one run/flow):\n  a) An outline\n  b) 3–5 credible source links\n  c) Final copy in markdown\n- Role constraints:\n  - Writer must cite the researcher’s sources\n  - Planner should ensure a clear buyer persona\n- Implicit needs: orchestration across agents so researcher’s outputs and planner’s persona flow into the writer; ability to control output format and collect the three requested artifacts.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation (inferred)\n- Would use agno.Agent and agno.Team (or agno.workflow.Workflow) to define Planner, Researcher (with web search tool), and Writer agents\n- Researcher likely uses DuckDuckGoTools or GoogleSearchTools to gather 3–5 sources, returning typed results (e.g., SearchResults with NewsArticle items containing title/url)\n- Planner outputs a buyer persona artifact consumed by Writer and possibly Researcher\n- Writer generates:\n  - Outline\n  - Final markdown copy with a Sources section citing the exact URLs from the Researcher\n- Orchestration: sequential flow (Planner → Researcher → Writer) with explicit data passing; possibly using output_schema with Pydantic models\n- Return: structured result bundling outline, sources, final markdown\n- Error handling: handling tool/search failures or missing content extraction gracefully\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage vs Requirements\n1) API/Function names\n- Present for agents/teams:\n  - Agent, Team, OpenAIChat, and tools (DuckDuckGoTools, GoogleSearchTools, Newspaper4kTools) are shown. Example: “from agno.agent import Agent … from agno.team import Team … from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools” (Define Agno Content Team).\n- Workflow class exists (“from agno.workflow import RunOutput, Workflow” and “class BlogPostGenerator(Workflow): …”), indicating a path to multi-stage orchestration.\n- Calls shown: Team.print_response(…) and team.cli_app(…)\n- Missing: explicit API for capturing an Agent’s return programmatically within a Team run (e.g., agent.run / team.run with return object) and for passing outputs between team members.\n\n2) Parameter types\n- Agents: name, role, model, tools, instructions, description, markdown, output_schema (e.g., “research_agent = Agent(…, tools=[GoogleSearchTools()], …, output_schema=SearchResults)”)\n- Team: name, members, model, instructions, show_members_responses, markdown; also flags like get_member_information_tool and add_member_tools_to_context (multi-agent research team example)\n- Workflow: output_schema for agents and Pydantic models (NewsArticle, SearchResults, ScrapedArticle). Types are inferable from the examples.\n\n3) Parameter names/purposes\n- Clearly demonstrated in examples and doc strings. Writer instruction block shows how to enforce a structured markdown output including a Sources section (“Format your blog post with this structure … ## Sources {Properly attributed sources with links}”).\n- However, no explicit parameter or mechanism is shown to pass the researcher’s concrete links into the writer’s prompt context in a deterministic programmatic way inside a Team run.\n\n4) Return value structure\n- For Agents with output_schema: structure is clear (e.g., SearchResults.articles: list[NewsArticle] with url/title/summary).\n- For Team operations: Team.print_response outputs to console; return type structure not documented in the snippets.\n- For Workflow: The pattern implies structured outputs, but the provided snippet is incomplete (writer agent definition cut off; no run example), so the exact run output and how to gather composite deliverables (outline + sources + final markdown) is not fully shown.\n\n5) Usage patterns\n- Creating agents and teams and running a prompt: yes (“content_team.print_response(…)”).\n- Multi-agent collaborative patterns: yes at a high level (“Team Process: 1. Research … 2. Creative … 3. Writing … 4. Editing …”).\n- Orchestrated multi-stage blog workflow: partially shown; schemas and agents provided but full runnable orchestration is not in the excerpt.\n- Passing data between agents: not clearly demonstrated for Team. Workflow hints at this but lacks a complete runnable example showing how outputs feed subsequent steps and how to aggregate final deliverables.\n\n6) Error handling\n- Not demonstrated. No examples of exceptions, retry behavior, or error-handling hooks for tools/agents/teams/workflows.\n\nPer-requirement assessment\n- Multi-agent team with roles including Planner: Agents/Team creation is covered; a Planner can be defined analogously to other Agents, but there is no example of ensuring the planner’s buyer persona is programmatically enforced downstream beyond instructions.\n- 3–5 credible source links: The research agent with GoogleSearchTools and output_schema=SearchResults provides a way to generate and structure sources (“output_schema=SearchResults”; NewsArticle.url). Credibility criteria can be enforced by instructions.\n- Writer must cite researcher’s sources: Writer instructions include a Sources section, but the mechanism to guarantee citing exactly the researcher’s URLs (data passing) is not documented for Team; Workflow path is incomplete in the provided context.\n- Outline + final copy in markdown: Writer instruction template supports structured markdown with headings, but an explicit “outline” artifact separate from the post is not pre-defined. It can be instructed, but there’s no example of returning multiple artifacts together from a Team run.\n- Orchestration and aggregation: The Workflow examples suggest how to structure multi-stage outputs, but essential code showing execution, data flow, and final aggregation is missing.\n- Error handling: Not covered.\n\nEvidence quotes\n- Agents/Team creation: “Create individual specialized agents… content_team = Team(members=[researcher, writer], …); content_team.print_response(…)”\n- Research agent with structured outputs: “research_agent = Agent(…, tools=[GoogleSearchTools()], …, output_schema=SearchResults)” and models: “class NewsArticle(BaseModel): title … url … summary …”\n- Writer with Sources section: “Format your blog post with this structure … ## Sources {Properly attributed sources with links}”\n- Multi-stage workflow (incomplete): “class BlogPostGenerator(Workflow): … searcher: Agent = Agent(…, output_schema=SearchResults) … article_scraper: Agent = Agent(…, output_schema=ScrapedArticle) … writer: Agent = Agent(… [truncated])”\n- Team collaboration pattern: “Team Process: 1. Research Phase … 2. Creative Phase … 3. Writing Phase … 4. Editing Phase”\n\nStep 4: Decision\n- Completeness: INCOMPLETE. While the context is highly relevant and provides many building blocks (Agents, Team, Tools, structured output schemas, writer’s markdown structure), critical information is missing to implement the oracle’s full functionality without guessing:\n  - No documented mechanism in the provided snippets for deterministically passing the researcher’s SearchResults (specific URLs) into the writer’s prompt within a Team run, to guarantee citing those exact sources.\n  - No complete Workflow example showing execution, inter-agent data flow, and aggregation of the three required artifacts (outline, 3–5 links, final markdown) into a single structured return.\n  - No examples of error handling patterns.\n- Relevance: HIGH. The materials directly target Agno multi-agent content teams and blog workflows.\n\nOverall: Score 3 (Average). Strongly relevant building blocks exist, but critical orchestration and return-structure details are missing to confidently implement all user requirements end-to-end based solely on this context."

      "relevance": true,
      "overall_score": 5,
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "Step 1: User Requirements - The query requests a content generation system using the Agno Python framework and multi-agent teams to produce a 1-page blog post for launching a stainless, eco-friendly water bottle. Specific outputs: (a) outline, (b) 3-5 credible source links, (c) final copy in markdown. Additional requirements: writer must cite researcher's sources; planner must ensure a clear buyer persona. Explicit constraints: Use Agno framework, multi-agent teams, citations from researcher, buyer persona integration, markdown output.\n\nStep 2: Oracle Implementation Details - The oracle would involve importing Agno components (e.g., Agent, Team, OpenAIChat, DuckDuckGoTools or similar). It would create agents like Planner (with instructions for buyer persona), Researcher (with search tools for credible sources), and Writer (with instructions to cite sources and generate outline, links, markdown copy). Form a Team with these members, custom instructions, and run it with a task for the water bottle blog post. Parameters: Agent(name=str, role=str, model=OpenAIChat(id=str), tools=list, instructions=str or list, output_schema=optional Pydantic model); Team(name=str, members=list[Agent], instructions=str or list, model=OpenAIChat). Returns: Team methods like print_response(str) or cli_app() to generate output. Usage includes running the team to produce structured content.\n\nStep 3: MCP Context Coverage - For building multi-agent teams: Context provides full examples (e.g., 'Define Agno Content Team with Researcher and Writer Agents' shows Agent creation with name, role, tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], model=OpenAIChat(id='gpt-5-mini'), and Team with members, instructions, model; usage via content_team.print_response()). Parameters inferable (e.g., types from code: str for name/role/instructions, list for tools/members). Returns inferable (e.g., print_response outputs responses). For producing outline/sources/markdown: Examples like 'Agno Workflow for Multi-Stage Blog Post Generation' show workflows with searcher (outputs SearchResults with articles list), scraper (outputs ScrapedArticle with markdown content), writer (instructions for structured markdown output including sections, takeaways, sources). Citing sources: Agent instructions explicitly cover 'Cite sources properly', 'Include expert quotes', 'Maintain factual accuracy' (e.g., in blog_writer_agent). Buyer persona: Not directly mentioned, but inferable via customizable instructions (e.g., examples show adding specific instructions like 'Audience Targeting: Tailor ideas to specific audiences' in brainstorm_agent; can create Planner agent with custom instructions for buyer persona). Usage patterns: Full code snippets show how to call and integrate (e.g., Team creation and run methods). Error handling: Implicit in examples (e.g., handling optional fields like summary=None), but basic inference possible from Pydantic models.\n\nStep 4: Decision - Completeness=true because all requirements are addressable: API names (Agent, Team), parameters (e.g., tools=list from examples), returns (e.g., structured outputs via schemas), usage (full snippets), and custom elements like buyer persona can be inferred from instruction customization without guessing. No explicit constraints unmet (Agno framework covered extensively). Relevance=true as context directly provides Agno team/workflow examples for content generation with research, writing, citations, and markdown. Overall excellent quality with clear, inferable info."
