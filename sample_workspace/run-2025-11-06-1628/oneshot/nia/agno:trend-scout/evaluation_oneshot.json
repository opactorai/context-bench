      "reasoning": "Step 1 – User requirements:\n- Build a trend scout agent using the Agno Python framework\n- Find the top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News right now\n- Cross-check each with the latest web coverage\n- Produce a tight brief per tool: 3 bullet takeaways, links (HN + news), and a 1-sentence risk note\n\nStep 2 – Oracle implementation (inferred from context snippets):\n- Uses Agno Agent with a model (OpenAIChat or Claude)\n- Integrates Hacker News capability via either:\n  • Built-in: agno.tools.hackernews.HackerNewsTools (Result 1)\n  • Custom tool function using httpx to HN API (Results 2–4)\n- Patterns shown: agent = Agent(model=..., tools=[...], instructions=..., markdown=True), agent.print_response(prompt, stream=True)\n- Example function signatures and returns:\n  • get_top_hackernews_stories(num_stories: int = 10) -> str (JSON string of stories) [Result 2]\n  • Similar variant with num_stories: int = 5 and excluding kids [Results 3–4]\n- No explicit web search/news coverage tool usage shown; no error handling examples\n\nStep 3 – MCP context coverage vs. requirements:\n1) Build agent with Agno\n   - API/function names: Agent, OpenAIChat, Claude, tools, dependencies, print_response are shown.\n     Evidence: “from agno.agent import Agent”, “from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat”, “from agno.models.anthropic import Claude”, “tools=[HackerNewsTools()]”, “agent.print_response(..., stream=True)” (Results 1–4)\n   - Parameters: model, tools, instructions, dependencies, add_dependencies_to_context, markdown are clear from examples (Results 2–4)\n   - Return/usage: agent.print_response streams output; usage pattern shown (Results 1–4)\n   - Error handling: None shown\n   Conclusion: Mostly covered except error handling\n\n2) Find top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News right now\n   - API/function names: get_top_hackernews_stories() or HackerNewsTools()\n     Evidence: “def get_top_hackernews_stories(num_stories: int = 10) -> str” (Result 2); “tools=[HackerNewsTools()]” (Result 1)\n   - Parameters: num_stories int (can set to 3) (Results 2–4)\n   - Return structure: JSON string of story dicts (title, url, score, etc.; kids removed in some examples) (Results 2–4)\n   - Usage patterns: add function to tools or as dependency; prompt agent to summarize (Results 2–4)\n   - Filtering for “emerging AI tools”: Not directly provided; would rely on LLM prompt over returned stories (inferable but not explicit)\n   - Error handling: None\n   Conclusion: Enough to fetch top HN items; AI-tool filtering left to LLM. Acceptable, though not explicit\n\n3) Cross-check with latest web coverage\n   - Required APIs/functions: Some web search/news or web browsing tool\n   - Context: No web search or news API/tool examples are provided in retrieved snippets\n     Evidence: Only HackerNewsTools and custom httpx to HN API are shown (Results 1–4). No agno.tools.web, search, or news tool references\n   - Parameters/returns/usage for web coverage: Not inferable\n   - Error handling: Not shown\n   Conclusion: Missing critical capability; cannot implement cross-checking from context alone\n\n4) Output formatting: tight brief with 3 bullet takeaways, links (HN + news), 1-sentence risk note per tool\n   - Instructions mechanism is shown (Agent instructions list/string) (Results 2–4)\n   - HN links: The story JSON includes id and url; constructing the HN discussion link (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=ID) is not shown in context; would require guessing\n   - News links: Would come from web coverage tool – which is missing\n   Conclusion: Partially supported (instructions), but links requirement not fully addressable without web tool and HN link construction guidance\n\nChecklist assessment:\n1. API/function names – Partially: Agent/HN functions shown; web coverage tool absent → critical gap\n2. Parameter types – For Agent and HN functions yes; for web coverage no\n3. Parameter names/purposes – For Agent/HN yes; for web coverage no\n4. Return value structure – For HN functions yes (JSON string of stories); for web coverage no\n5. Usage patterns – For Agent/HN yes; for web coverage no\n6. Error handling – Not demonstrated anywhere\n\nStep 4 – Decision:\n- Completeness: FALSE. The context lacks any web search/news coverage tool APIs, parameters, return types, or usage patterns needed for the “cross-check with the latest web coverage” requirement. Error handling patterns are also absent. Providing HN + news links cannot be fully implemented from the retrieved context.\n- Relevance: TRUE. The snippets are directly relevant to building an Agno agent and fetching Hacker News content, which is central to the task.\n\nEvidence quotes:\n- “from agno.tools.hackernews import HackerNewsTools… tools=[HackerNewsTools()]” (cookbook/tools/hackernews_tools.py)\n- “def get_top_hackernews_stories(num_stories: int = 10) -> str … return json.dumps(stories)” (cookbook/getting_started/04_write_your_own_tool.py)\n- “dependencies={\"top_hackernews_stories\": get_top_hackernews_stories} … instructions=[… \"Here are the top stories on HackerNews: {top_hackernews_stories}\"]” (cookbook/agents/dependencies/reference_dependencies.py)\n- No references to any web search/news tools in retrieved files"

      "relevance": true,
      "overall_score": 3,
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "1. List of user requirements: The query requires building a trend scout agent using the Agno Python framework to (a) find the top 3 emerging AI tools from Hacker News (HN) right now, (b) cross-check them with the latest web coverage, and (c) output a tight brief with 3 bullet takeaways, links (HN + news), and a 1-sentence risk note per tool. Explicit constraints: Must use the Agno Python framework; no specific model or version mentioned, but implies real-time HN access and web search capabilities.\n\n2. Oracle's implementation details: The oracle code would likely involve creating an Agno Agent with a model (e.g., Claude or OpenAIChat), tools or dependencies for fetching and analyzing HN top stories to identify emerging AI tools, a web search tool to cross-check with latest coverage (e.g., finding news links), and instructions to format the output as specified. Key APIs/functions: agno.agent.Agent, model classes like Claude or OpenAIChat, custom tools like get_top_hackernews_stories (using httpx for HN API), and a web search tool (not present). Parameters: For HN tool, num_stories (int); returns JSON string of stories. Usage: Instantiate Agent with model, tools/dependencies, instructions; call print_response or similar. Error handling: Implicit in examples (e.g., HTTP requests via httpx).\n\n3. For each requirement: (a) Finding top 3 emerging AI tools from HN: Context provides sufficient info - Result 1 shows Agent with HackerNewsTools; Results 2-4 show custom get_top_hackernews_stories function (API name inferable, params: num_stories=int, purpose: fetch top stories, return: JSON string of stories with title/url/score, usage: as tool or dependency in Agent, error handling: via httpx). Inference possible for identifying AI tools via agent analysis. (b) Cross-checking with latest web coverage: Context lacks any web search tools or APIs; no examples of web scraping, search integration, or news fetching in Agno - cannot infer API names, params, returns, or usage for this. (c) Output formatting: Inferable from agent instructions in examples (e.g., Result 2's style guide), but tied to full functionality.\n\n4. Clear decision: Incomplete (false) because the context does not address the cross-checking with web coverage requirement - no inferable APIs, params, returns, or usage for web/news search, requiring guessing or external knowledge; explicit constraint of using Agno is met for HN part, but not all requirements are addressable. Evidence: Result 2 quotes custom HN tool: 'def get_top_hackernews_stories(num_stories: int = 10) -> str: ... return json.dumps(stories)'; no equivalent for web search.\n\nWhat was done well: Strong coverage of Agno Agent setup and HN integration. What could be improved: Include web search tools/examples for full query support."
