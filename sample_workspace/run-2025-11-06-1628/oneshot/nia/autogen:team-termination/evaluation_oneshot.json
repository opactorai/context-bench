Each line should be concise and impactful.\" Usage pattern is clear.\n\n3) Critic review and APPROVE; otherwise iterate\n   - Critic agent system_message specifies criteria and final action: \"When all criteria are met, respond with 'APPROVE'.\"\n   - Iteration enforced by RoundRobinGroupChat; termination on approval via: TextMentionTermination(\"APPROVE\"). Example: \"combined_termination = text_termination | max_msg_termination\".\n\n4) Turn budget auto-stop\n   - Implemented via MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=8) and combined with OR. Example: \"max_msg_termination = MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=8)\" and OR operator usage.\n\nChecklist satisfaction\n- API/function names: Yes (explicit imports and class names).\n- Parameter types: Yes (string for TextMentionTermination, int for MaxMessageTermination, list of agents for team, model name string and float for temperature).\n- Parameter names/purposes: Yes (names shown and commented; e.g., max_messages=8 limits turn budget; termination_condition explained).\n- Return value structure: Sufficiently inferable from usage with Console and await; no guessing needed to implement identical behavior.\n- Usage patterns: Yes (complete runnable async example with execution).\n- Error handling: The oracle code does not include explicit error handling; the context matches that. Implementation equivalent to the oracle does not require additional error handling.\n\nEvidence quotes\n- Termination OR logic: \"combined_termination = text_termination | max_msg_termination\"\n- Approval trigger: \"TextMentionTermination(\"APPROVE\")\"\n- Turn budget: \"MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=8)\"\n- Team construction: \"team = RoundRobinGroupChat([writer_agent, critic_agent], termination_condition=combined_termination)\"\n- Execution: \"await Console(team.run_stream(task=task))\"\n- Critic instruction: \"When all criteria are met, respond with 'APPROVE'.\"\n\nDecision\n- Completeness: True. The MCP context provides a full, runnable example with clear APIs, parameters, return usage, and patterns that directly satisfy all user requirements without guessing.\n- Relevance: True. The context directly implements the requested multi-agent team with termination conditions, iteration until approval, and a turn budget stop."

Step 2: Oracle Implementation - Uses AssistantAgent, RoundRobinGroupChat, TextMentionTermination, MaxMessageTermination, model configuration, and team orchestration. Step 3: MCP Context Coverage - The context provides complete implementation with: AssistantAgent class with system_message parameter, RoundRobinGroupChat team structure with agent list parameter, TextMentionTermination with 'APPROVE' text, MaxMessageTermination with max_messages=8, combined termination using OR operator (|), OpenAIChatCompletionClient configuration with model and temperature parameters, and full usage pattern with await Console(team.run_stream(task=task)). All API signatures, parameters types (string for text, integer for max_messages), return patterns, and error handling are clearly inferable from the working code example. The context specifically addresses GPT-4o usage as shown in model='gpt-4o' parameter. Step 4: Decision - ALL user requirements are fully addressable with no guessing required based on the comprehensive example."

      "reasoning": "Step 1: Analyze User Requirements\nThe user's query requests: (1) Building a multi-agent system using the Autogen Python library, specifically with teams and termination conditions. (2) Drafting a 6-line product tagline for a sustainable water bottle. (3) A critic agent that reviews and must APPROVE the tagline; otherwise, iterate. (4) Automatic stopping if a small turn budget is exceeded. Explicit constraints include using Autogen library, teams, termination conditions, a writer-critic setup with approval-based iteration, and a max turn limit for termination.\n\nStep 2: Analyze Oracle Implementation\nThe oracle code uses: APIs/functions like AssistantAgent, TextMentionTermination, MaxMessageTermination, RoundRobinGroupChat, Console, OpenAIChatCompletionClient. Parameters include system_message for agents, model='gpt-4o' for the client, max_messages=8 for termination, and task string for run_stream. Return types involve async execution and streaming output. Usage patterns include combining terminations with | operator, alternating turns in RoundRobinGroupChat, and running via asyncio.run(main()). Error handling is implicit in termination conditions.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate MCP Context Coverage\nFor requirement (1): Context provides full code example with imports, AssistantAgent creation, and RoundRobinGroupChat for teams. API names, parameters (e.g., system_message, model_client), return structures (e.g., async run_stream), and usage (e.g., 'team = RoundRobinGroupChat([writer_agent, critic_agent], termination_condition=combined_termination)') are directly shown. For requirement (2): Context includes writer agent's system_message focused on generating a 6-line tagline, with task description. Parameters and usage are inferable from code. For requirement (3): Critic agent's system_message requires 'APPROVE' response, with TextMentionTermination('APPROVE') shown; iteration via group chat. All checklist items (API names, param types like str for 'APPROVE', returns, usage like 'text_termination = TextMentionTermination(\"APPROVE\")') are inferable. For requirement (4): MaxMessageTermination(max_messages=8) for small budget, combined with | operator; usage pattern: 'combined_termination = text_termination | max_msg_termination'. All 6 checklist items are covered for each requirement, with no guessing needed.\n\nStep 4: Clear Decision\nCompleteness = true because ALL user requirements are fully addressable from the context, with all critical information (APIs, params like max_messages=8, returns, usage patterns like combining terminations, error handling via conditions) explicitly provided or inferable without guessing. Relevance = true as the context directly implements the requested functionality. Overall score = 5 (Excellent) due to comprehensive, clear code and explanations enabling confident implementation. Confidence = high based on explicit evidence.\n\nEvidence Quotes: 'combined_termination = text_termination | max_msg_termination' for termination logic; 'team = RoundRobinGroupChat([writer_agent, critic_agent], termination_condition=combined_termination)' for team setup; 'TextMentionTermination(\"APPROVE\")' for approval condition."
