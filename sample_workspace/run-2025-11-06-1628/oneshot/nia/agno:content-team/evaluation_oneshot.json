      "reasoning": "Step 1: User requirements\n- Build a multi-agent content generation system using the Agno Python framework and teams.\n- Produce three outputs for a stainless, eco-friendly water bottle launch: (a) outline, (b) 3–5 credible source links, (c) final 1-page blog post in markdown.\n- Role constraints: planner ensures a clear buyer persona; researcher finds credible sources; writer must cite the researcher's sources.\n- Implicit needs: orchestration/turn-taking across agents, passing artifacts (persona, outline, sources) between agents, and capturing structured outputs.\n\nStep 2: Oracle implementation (not provided)\n- The oracle code is not included in the MCP context. Based on the requirements, it likely uses Agno Agent and Team constructs, a research tool (e.g., DuckDuckGoTools), OpenAI models, and a way to coordinate agent outputs and enforce citation/hand-offs. Without the oracle, we cannot verify exact APIs or error handling it used.\n\nStep 3: MCP context coverage vs. requirements\n1) API/function names\n- Present: Agent, Team, Message, OpenAIChat, DuckDuckGoTools.\n  Evidence:\n  - from agno.agent import Agent; from agno.team import Team; from agno.models.message import Message (input_as_messages_list.py)\n  - from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat; from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools (run_as_cli.py)\n- Missing: Any APIs for orchestrating sequential tasks between agents (planner → researcher → writer), passing artifacts, or enforcing citation dependencies.\n\n2) Parameter types\n- Partially inferable:\n  - Agent(name: str, role: str, instructions: str, model=OpenAIChat(id=...), tools=[...]) (run_as_cli.py)\n  - Team(name: str, members: list[Agent], stream: bool, markdown: bool) (input_as_messages_list.py)\n  - Message(role: str, content: str) (input_as_messages_list.py)\n- Missing: Parameters for controlling workflows, capturing outputs, or linking agent outputs.\n\n3) Parameter names/purposes\n- Present for basic construction of Agent/Team/Message as above.\n- Missing for any higher-level coordination (e.g., how to route research results to the writer, how to specify persona enforcement by planner).\n\n4) Return value structure\n- Not inferable for key operations. Team.print_response([...], markdown=True) appears to print to stdout; no return type or structure is shown. There’s no example of programmatically retrieving outputs such as outline, sources, and final copy as structured data.\n  Evidence: research_team.print_response([...], markdown=True) (input_as_messages_list.py) with no assignment or mention of return value.\n\n5) Usage patterns\n- Present: Minimal examples of\n  - Creating Agents with models/tools and instructions (run_as_cli.py)\n  - Creating a Team and invoking print_response with a list of Message objects (input_as_messages_list.py)\n- Missing: Patterns for multi-step team workflows, role handoffs, ensuring the writer cites researcher’s sources, ensuring planner defines and propagates the buyer persona, and producing multiple distinct deliverables (outline, sources, final markdown) in a controlled sequence.\n\n6) Error handling\n- No error handling patterns are present in the provided snippets.\n\nStep 4: Decision\n- Completeness: False. Although relevant APIs (Agent, Team, Message, OpenAIChat, DuckDuckGoTools) are shown, critical information to fully implement the requested system is missing: orchestration/turn-taking across agents, passing and consuming intermediate artifacts (persona, sources), ensuring citation linkage, capturing outputs programmatically, and any error handling.\n\nSpecific evidence quotes\n- Team creation and print:\n  \"research_team = Team(name='Research Team', members=[Agent(...), Agent(...)], stream=True, markdown=True)\" and \"research_team.print_response([...], markdown=True)\" (input_as_messages_list.py)\n- Agent with model and tools:\n  \"research_agent = Agent(..., model=OpenAIChat(id='gpt-4o-mini'), tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()], instructions=dedent(...))\" (run_as_cli.py)\n\nConclusion\n- Relevance: True (directly about Agno teams and content creation agents with research tools).\n- Completeness: False due to missing orchestration, artifact passing, structured returns, and error handling needed to implement the full oracle functionality without guessing."

      "reasoning": "The MCP context provides basic team structure examples but lacks critical information needed to implement the specific content generation system. Key gaps include: (1) No information on how to create a planner agent that ensures buyer personas, (2) No examples showing how to coordinate between researcher and writer agents for source citation, (3) Missing details on how to structure the specific output requirements (outline, source links, markdown copy), (4) No examples of multi-agent collaboration patterns for the required workflow. While the context shows basic Agent and Team creation, it doesn't demonstrate the coordination, citation, and persona planning requirements specified in the user query."

      "relevance": true,
      "overall_score": 4,
      "confidence": "high",
      "reasoning": "1. List of user requirements: The query requires using the Agno Python framework to create a multi-agent team for content generation focused on launching a stainless, eco-friendly water bottle. The team must produce a 1-page blog post including: (a) an outline, (b) 3-5 credible source links, (c) final copy in markdown. Additional constraints: the writer must cite the researcher's sources, and the planner should ensure a clear buyer persona. Explicit technical specifications: Agno framework with multi-agent teams; no specific models or versions mentioned beyond Agno, but implies agents with roles like planner, researcher, and writer.\n\n2. Oracle's implementation details: Since no explicit oracle code is provided, I infer the oracle would involve importing from agno (e.g., Agent, Team, OpenAIChat, DuckDuckGoTools), defining Agents with specific names, roles, instructions (e.g., planner for buyer persona, researcher for sources, writer for outline and final markdown with citations), assigning models like OpenAIChat('gpt-4o-mini'), tools like DuckDuckGoTools for research, creating a Team with these members, and running the team (e.g., via print_response) with input messages describing the task. Parameters would include strings for name/role/instructions, model objects, tool lists for Agents; Team params like name, members list, booleans for stream/markdown. Return types: Team methods like print_response likely return or print structured output (e.g., markdown responses). Error handling: Not explicitly shown, but inferred as standard Python exceptions from API calls.\n\n3. For each requirement: \n- Using Agno framework with multi-agent teams: Context provides API names (Agent, Team), parameters (e.g., name, role, instructions, model, tools for Agent; name, members, stream, markdown for Team), return structures (inferred as Team object with methods like print_response), usage patterns (examples of creating and running teams). Inferred from Result 1: 'research_team = Team(name=\"Research Team\", members=[Agent(...), Agent(...)], stream=True, markdown=True)' and 'research_team.print_response([Message(...)], markdown=True)'. Result 2 shows Agent creation with tools and models.\n- Content generation system for specific topic (water bottle launch): Context allows inferring custom instructions for agents to handle topic-specific tasks; parameters like instructions are strings, inferable from examples like 'instructions=\"Focus on gathering and analyzing data\"'.\n- Produce 1-page blog post with (a) outline, (b) 3-5 credible sources, (c) final markdown: Context shows agent roles for research (sources via DuckDuckGoTools), writing (outline and final copy), editing; usage via team response to messages. Inferred parameters/returns from Result 2 agents like Research Specialist (tools for sources/links), Content Writer (structured writing), Editor (quality). Team output inferable as markdown from 'markdown=True'.\n- Writer cites researcher's sources: Inferable by setting instructions for writer agent, as in examples like 'instructions=dedent(\"\"\"You are a skilled content writer! ... Create: Well-structured articles\"\"\")'.\n- Planner ensures clear buyer persona: Inferable by adding a planner agent with instructions, similar to Brainstorm Agent in Result 2 for audience targeting.\nAll 6 checklist items inferable: API names from imports, parameter types/names from examples (e.g., strings, lists, booleans), returns from method calls (e.g., print_response outputs response), usage from full code snippets, error handling as standard Python (no specific info, but not critical as it's inferable).\n\n4. Clear decision: Complete (true) because ALL user requirements are addressable; the context provides sufficient examples to infer API signatures, parameters, returns, and usage for creating a custom team with roles matching the needs (e.g., researcher for sources, writer for citing and markdown). No explicit constraints violated (Agno is covered), and no guessing required—everything is evidenced in code. However, note that 1 result was omitted, which might add more, but based on provided context, it's sufficient. Relevance is true as context directly shows Agno team creation for content tasks like research and writing.\n\n5. Quote specific examples from context as evidence: From Result 1: 'from agno.agent import Agent\nfrom agno.models.message import Message\nfrom agno.team import Team' (API imports); 'Agent(name=\"Sarah\", role=\"Data Researcher\", instructions=\"Focus on gathering and analyzing data\")' (Agent params); 'research_team.print_response([Message(role=\"user\", content=\"...\")], markdown=True)' (usage and params). From Result 2: 'tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()]' (for sources); 'instructions=dedent(\"\"\"You are an expert research specialist! ... Provide: Multiple reliable sources\"\"\")' (custom instructions for citing/sources). Overall score 4 (Good): Most info inferable with minor interpretation for exact collaboration flow, but no blocking gaps. Confidence high: Clear code examples provide strong evidence."
