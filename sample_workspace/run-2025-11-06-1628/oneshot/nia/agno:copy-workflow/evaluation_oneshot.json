From the scenario, the oracle likely uses:\n- agno.workflow.step.Step / StepInput / StepOutput\n- agno.workflow.workflow.Workflow to chain steps\n- agno.agent.Agent with a model (e.g., OpenAIChat) and deterministic params (e.g., temperature=0 or seed)\n- Capturing and printing/logging each step’s outputs\nBecause the oracle code isn’t actually shown, exact parameter/return signatures and usage patterns cannot be derived from this MCP context alone.\n\nStep 3: MCP context coverage vs requirements\n- APIs/Function names: Partially present\n  • Evidence: “from agno.workflow.step import Step; from agno.workflow.types import StepInput, StepOutput; from agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow” (Result 1, lines 7-13)\n  • Evidence: Structured IO example imports the same (Result 3, lines 1-11)\n- Parameters: Missing\n  • No signatures or examples showing how to define a Step, how StepInput/StepOutput are structured, or how to construct Workflow with steps.\n- Return values: Missing\n  • No documentation or examples of StepOutput structure or what Workflow.run returns.\n- Usage patterns: Missing/insufficient\n  • No code showing how to create steps, connect them in a Workflow, pass inputs, access outputs, or print intermediate step results.\n  • Result 3 only defines Pydantic models; it does not show step functions or workflow orchestration.\n- Determinism controls: Missing\n  • While OpenAIChat is imported (Result 1), there is no evidence of temperature/seed parameters to ensure determinism, nor how to set them in Agno.\n- Error handling: Missing\n  • No examples indicating how to handle model/tool errors within steps or the workflow.\n\nStep 4: Decision\n- Completeness: False.

      "reasoning": "### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements\nThe user's query requests building a deterministic copy generation workflow using the Agno Python framework's workflow system. Specific functionality includes: (1) Taking a 'spec' as input to produce a short landing page consisting of a headline, 3 benefits, and a CTA; (2) Generating a Spanish translation of that landing page content; (3) Ensuring the style is crisp and product-led; (4) Making the entire process deterministic; (5) Showing step outputs. Explicit constraints: Must use Agno's workflow system; the process must be deterministic (e.g., via fixed seeds, temperature=0 in models, or other mechanisms to ensure reproducibility); outputs should be structured and visible per step. Technical specifications: Involves multi-step processing (generation then translation), with emphasis on determinism and step-by-step output visibility.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Oracle Implementation\nThe oracle code is not explicitly provided in the input, but based on the query and Agno framework context, it would likely involve: (1) Importing and using Agno classes like Workflow, Step, Agent, StepInput, StepOutput, and models (e.g., OpenAIChat or Claude); (2) Defining structured Pydantic models for inputs/outputs (e.g., a model for the English landing page with fields for headline, benefits, and CTA, and another for the Spanish translation); (3) Creating a Workflow with chained Steps (e.g., one Step for generating English content using an Agent with a language model, another for translation); (4) Parameters such as model IDs, instructions for crisp/product-led style, temperature=0 for determinism, and flags like add_history_to_context or markdown=True for output handling; (5) Return types as structured Pydantic models or StepOutput; (6) Error handling via Agno's built-in mechanisms (inferred from context, e.g., Agent/db configurations); (7) Running the workflow to produce and display step outputs deterministically.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate MCP Context Coverage\nFor each user requirement, I checked the Required Information Checklist against the MCP context:\n\n1. **Use Agno workflow system**: Context provides API/function names (e.g., from agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow; from agno.workflow.step import Step in Results 1 and 3). Parameter types/names/purposes can be partially inferred (e.g., Workflow likely takes Steps, based on imports and Result 3's structure). Return value structure is inferable as StepOutput from imports. Usage patterns are partially shown in Result 3 (defining models for structured IO, implying Steps use them), but no full example of initializing/running a Workflow. Error handling is not explicitly inferable.\n\n2. **Build deterministic copy generation workflow**: Context shows Agent configurations (Result 2) with models like Claude or OpenAIChat, where determinism could be inferred via parameters (e.g., temperature not shown but guessable). However, no explicit info on making processes deterministic (e.g., setting seeds or temperature=0). Usage patterns for workflows are incomplete; Result 3 cuts off before showing Workflow creation.\n\n3. **From spec, produce headline, 3 benefits, CTA**: Structured models in Result 3 (e.g., ResearchFindings(BaseModel) with fields like key_insights: List[str], confidence_score: float) demonstrate how to define Pydantic models for structured outputs (inferable parameters: field descriptions, types like List[str], constraints like min_items=3). This matches the need for structured landing page elements. Agents in Result 2 show model usage for generation. Return structures are inferable from BaseModel examples. However, usage for integrating into Steps (e.g., how to pass spec as StepInput) requires some guessing.\n\n4. **Spanish translation**: Context has no direct translation examples, but Agents with models (Results 1-2) imply using language models for tasks like translation. Parameters/returns would be inferable by extending structured models (e.g., a new BaseModel for translated fields). Usage patterns: Chaining steps (e.g., output of generation Step as input to translation Step) is not shown; must guess from imports like StepInput/StepOutput.\n\n5. **Style: crisp, product-led**: This is prompt-based; context shows Agent instructions (Result 2, e.g., instructions=AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS) and expected_output templates, inferring how to pass style via prompts. Parameters inferable, but no explicit usage for custom styles in workflows.\n\n6. **Deterministic process and show step outputs**: Determinism not directly addressed (must guess model params like temperature). Step outputs: Imports show StepOutput, and Result 2 has flags like markdown=True, add_history_to_context=True, implying output visibility. However, no full pattern for displaying per-step outputs in a Workflow run.\n\nOverall, the context provides partial coverage: API names and some signatures are inferable from imports (e.g., 'from agno.workflow.workflow import Workflow' in Result 1), parameter types from Pydantic examples (e.g., 'key_insights: List[str] = Field(..., min_items=3)' in Result 3), and basic usage from Agent setups (Result 2). However, critical gaps exist: No full Workflow initialization/run example; chaining Steps for multi-step processes (generation → translation) must be guessed; determinism mechanisms not shown; error handling unclear. Note: Context mentions '1 matching results were omitted,' but evaluation is based on retrieved content only.\n\n### Step 4: Make Your Decision\nCompleteness = false because not ALL user requirements are fully addressable without guessing: Critical information like Workflow usage patterns (e.g., how to add Steps, chain them, and run deterministically) cannot be reliably inferred—only partial examples are provided, and explicit constraints like determinism are not covered. Relevance = true as the context directly addresses Agno workflows, Agents, and structured IO, matching the query's focus. Overall score = 3 (Average): Some key information is inferable (e.g., structured models from Result 3), but significant gaps in usage and determinism block confident implementation. Confidence = medium: Moderately confident due to clear evidence in partial examples, but ambiguity from incomplete code snippets requires interpretation."
