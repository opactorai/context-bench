  - id: parallel-brief
    query: "Using the LangGraph Python library with parallel graph execution and streaming, create a parallel research brief generator. Create a one-page research brief on 'small modular reactors'. Plan 3-5 sections, draft them in parallel, stream progress as each section completes, then merge into a single report."

    query: "Using the LangGraph Python library with subgraphs and multi-agent orchestration, build a two-agent blog writing system. Draft a 400-word blog post about 'edge AI on factories'. First a writer plans and drafts; then an editor polishes tone and clarity. Orchestrate the two agents as reusable subgraphs."
